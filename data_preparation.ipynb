      "        \"Sonneveld (PPE). \\u2013 (NL) Madam President, alongside its decision on compensation for the reduction in the price of cereals, the Agriculture Council also adapted the compensation paid for the production of starch potatoes. It was agreed to fix the compensation for potato growers, given solely in the form of hectare premiums, at a higher level than the Commission had proposed, provided that the number of hectares was reduced accordingly, so that the overall decision would be budget\\u2010neutral in relation to the original Commission proposal. This could only be achieved by reducing the national potato starch quotas by an agreed percentage, albeit in an adapted form, with the larger producers giving up more than the smaller.\",\n",
      "        \"The Council and the Commission rightly called for the European Parliament to take a decision on the compensation and the potato starch quotas simultaneously, simply as a matter of good management. If we approve this Commission proposal on reducing the quotas, we shall be making the growers\\\" incomes a little more secure; otherwise they would have been hit particularly hard by the new policy. In certain areas, the production of starch potatoes is a vital concern. The quota proposal, in conjunction with the decision on compensation for starch potato growers, has no effect whatsoever on the competitive position of the processing industry \\u2013 in actual fact the production of potato starch is being slightly reduced, so the producers of other starches can hardly object to that.\",\n",
      "        \"Madam President, I have always been proud that we have consistently succeeded in the CAP in finding sensible ways of linking the interests of primary producers and processors, while at the same time giving equal weight to the interests of consumers and taxpayers. The potato starch sector shows the successful operation of the CAP in a nutshell. It is a good example of an extremely dynamic and inventive sector which offers prospects for the non\\u2010food use of agricultural crops.

      "        \"Olsson (ELDR). \\u2013 (SV) Madam President, potato growing is a significant and promising area of agriculture, with its strong potential for new openings. Sweden has a fairly sizeable potato sector. Our negotiations for membership of the Union coincided with the dying days of alcohol production using potato starch. Now that this activity has ceased, potato growing \\u2013 for the purposes of industrial starch production \\u2013 has had to be cut back considerably. This in turn has led to problems for farmers in areas where the land is suited to such crops.\",\n",
      "        \"A new regulation is now being proposed, under which quotas will be reduced. The reductions will, however, be somewhat lower for countries with low\\u2010volume quotas. I find this a satisfactory solution. It is certainly better than it might have been. I have no objections; in fact, I applaud the proposal. What I would like to stress is the special value of potato starch as a raw material for industry. It is very good for paper manufacturing and there is scope for using it in many new sectors. This is the type of product that should be at the heart of our future investment and development strategies for agriculture.\",\n",
      "        \"van Dam (I\\u2010EDN). \\u2013 (NL) Madam President, the Commission proposal to reduce the production quotas for potato starch forms an integral part of the Agenda 2000 package approved in Berlin. It is therefore a good idea for us to deal with it as a matter of urgency today.\",\n",
      "        \"The regulation of the market in potato starch is closely linked to the regulation of the market in cereals, and rightly so, since potato starch producers are largely operating in the same market as the cereal starch industry. It is therefore extremely important that the subsidies for potato starch should be kept closely in line with the level of aid for cereals.\",\n",
      "        \"The Commission\\\"s original proposals seriously affected the balance between potato starch and cereal starch and would have had disastrous consequences for the incomes of potato starch producers. The Commission wanted to pay compensation of only 44\\u2009% of the price reduction, but the Council rightly corrected this by increasing the income premiums to 75\\u2009% of the price reduction. To keep this budget\\u2010neutral, the Council linked this decision to the regulation reducing the quotas, a solution that the sector can live with.\",\n",
      "        \"A reduction in the quotas is also very much in line with the current supply and demand situation on the potato starch market. A few years ago, the European quota was increased for political reasons. The new Germany was allocated a reserve of 110 000 tonnes, while the most recent Member States got a quota of almost 170 000 tonnes. All of this led to overproduction on the European market.\",\n",
      "        \"In short, the proposal to reduce the quotas deserves our full support. It enables potato starch producers to be offered reasonable compensation for the price reduction, and it is a decision which the current market situation also justifies.\",\n",
      "        \"Mulder (ELDR). \\u2013 (NL) Madam President, I had the opportunity earlier in the week to tell the House how important it was to deal with this proposal this week. It is entirely logical that we should vote on the potato starch sector in the same week that we have voted on Agenda 2000. My group believes that potato starch production is of enormous economic importance in certain areas of Europe, which is why it is absolutely vital that the balancing premium should be maintained. We think that potato starch and cereal starch should in principle always receive the same payments.\",\n",
      "        \"The Commission proposal to reduce the production quotas and increase the compensation payments for potato starch seems like a good idea, mainly because future developments on the world market could yet take us by surprise. I also think it is important that the Commission should ensure that the compensation payments are made directly to the farmers, if at all possible. If there are fewer middle\\u2010men, there is less chance that money will be used for other purposes, so we must ensure that wherever possible the payments go directly to the farmers.\",\n",
      "        \"Finally, I would like to say something this morning in support of the development of new technologies. There are a number of technological developments that would make potato starch an ideal sector to promote. I think the Commission needs to pursue an active policy here and should say that it is compulsory to use certain agricultural products in the interests of the environment. This would create a new market for such products and would also be good for the environment.\",\n",
      "        \"Gradin, Commission. \\u2010 Firstly I would like to express my appreciation for your acceptance of the urgency procedure for this proposal.

This includes price reductions and compensation for both cereals and starch potatoes.\",\n",

      "        \"Hoppenstedt (PPE), rapporteur. \\u2013 (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, when the House discussed Expo 2000 in 1990, Venice was still being mooted as a possibility. It was made clear that it would be tantamount to a natural disaster if Venice was chosen to host the exhibition. At the time, and without realising, of course, that I would be speaking as the rapporteur on the last day of this five\\u2010year parliamentary term, I said that if Venice was not going to be considered, Hanover should be Europe\\\"s representative to compete against Toronto. We know the outcome. Today, some ten years later, we are voting on how Europe is to participate.\",\n",
      "        \"There is quite a background to this, of course, because for the last 18 months we, and I myself in particular, have been working to move this whole project forward so as to ensure that there is adequate funding for the European Union to be represented at Hanover, and that is by no means an easy task, as you know. This was why we made such a push last year for the 1999 budget, and thanks to all those colleagues who recognised how important it was for the European Union to take part in Hanover, particularly in the year 2000, it was voted through. I would like to thank all those responsible.\",\n",
      "        \"I was entrusted with the report in March 1998, not March 1999 as it says here, and since then quite a lot has happened. However, the report itself has appeared rather late in the day. This was because the Lisbon World Exhibition was also important for the European Union and the Commission was very much taken up with it. But it was not too late, because the European Union will be in one of the Expo General Commissariat\\\"s pavilions and will have an excellent position at the head of the European Boulevard near the Plaza. I think the European Union has a good chance of attracting a large number of visitors. As I have said in my report, we do not want the entrance to the European Union to be through the back door to some building or other. No, the European Union must be open to all spectators, and this is what we have achieved through our work together. If we can look forward to a total budget of some EUR 15 million, including the 2000 budget, then it is all thanks to the efforts of our colleagues. And we need the money, because this pavilion looks both back to the past and forward to the future. The theme in Hanover is \\u2018Humankind \\u2013 Nature \\u2013 Technology\\\", depicted in various imaginative ways, and what institution could be in a better position than the European Union to bring together all the various ideas from around the world and in the Member States, and to disseminate these ideas to give new impetus for the future?\",\n",

The exhibition centre and buildings will not be disappearing, but are to remain as a living centre in Hanover and the European Union.\",\n",
      "        \"There is another European element in the European Union\\\"s exhibition on the theme of \\u2018Humankind \\u2013 Nature \\u2013 Technology\\\": the euro. The euro will be featured as one of the most recent developments that is of enormous importance for the future in particular, and we have arranged with the relevant bodies, including through requests made by our committees here in the House, to be able to use the euro as an electronic currency. I think that it is important for the many millions of visitors to be able to use the euro and to explain to other people how it will work in future.\",\n",

It is extremely important for the European Union to be involved in an event like Expo 2000, which will attract enormous attention from the media and the public. It is important to present an image of Europe for inward consumption, for the Union\\\"s own citizens, but also outwardly, for visitors from around the globe.\",\n",
      "        \"The EU must get closer to the people in its activities, raising its profile among passing trade, as it were, and the Expo is an ideal forum for this. In the Committee on Culture too we have repeatedly stressed that the exhibition should not just show Europe\\\"s economic successes, but should also illustrate the European Union\\\"s cultural diversity and in particular its successful programmes. I would also urge \\u2013 and this is addressed to the organisers of the exhibition \\u2013 that Parliament should be able to demonstrate its independent role in initiating these programmes, and it should be kept entirely separate from the Commission both in the pavilion and in the budget for the event.\",\n",
      "        \"Finally, I should also like to take the opportunity to urge the Council once again not just to be proud of our cultural achievements here, but to ensure that there is sufficient funding for the programmes, because there is absolutely no point in getting the public interested in all these wonderful programmes that the European Union organises if the level of funding is just a joke.\",\n",
      "        \"von Habsburg (PPE). \\u2013 (DE) Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Hoppenstedt most sincerely for his excellent report, which I have followed with great interest \\u2013 not so much the exhibition in Hanover as the problems that it has generated. I am also glad that Mr Elchlepp spoke on the subject, for the simple reason that he too produced a wonderful report on an earlier occasion which I still remember with pleasure. I would like to thank him once again for that report.\",\n",
      "        \"Like any exhibition, the Expo in Hanover will be very important if it is used for the right purpose, as Mr Hoppenstedt underlined. But I would also like to look a little further forward, because there will be other exhibitions in future, and we should be starting to think now about things that will be vital for these future events. Time and again the vital cultural dimension is missing, as Mr Hoppenstedt rightly said, yet this is one of Europe\\\"s great strengths, and we should focus more attention on the cultural side of things instead of selling it short.\",\n",
      "        \"Secondly, we should remember that we have not always done ourselves justice here, particularly at exhibitions. As the 2005 Expo is, I am delighted to say, to be held in Nagoya in Japan, I would point out that the exhibition in Osaka led to a number of scandalous bureaucratic blunders, when they built the Europe pavilion but refused to put up the Coudenhove\\u2010Kalergi statue. After a wave of protests the European Community, as it was then, explained that it could not afford it. Then came the most shameful thing of all \\u2013 the Japanese themselves bought a very fine Coudenhove\\u2010Kalergi statue for the pavilion. This also reminds me of something that happened here in this very building with a statue that was removed by the bureaucrats and has now been returned. We should think of our own roots, and when we go to Japan in particular \\u2013 and 2005 is not so far away \\u2013 we should focus on the links we have with these countries.\",\n",
      "        \"The fact is that we cannot afford to operate just within the European Union: we must also take Europe out into a world that is, whether we like it or not, becoming increasingly globalised and in which partnerships in the Far East are also of vital importance to us. This is why I feel that even today we should all be thinking about what to do in Nagoya. The Asians are, after all, our logical partners. They are a great deal more culturally aware than certain bureaucrats here, and they would be very impressed if we gave our culture pride of place.\",\n",
      "        \"I remember a Croatian exhibition that we had once that was Croatia\\\"s first appearance in this building. I was wrong at the time to insist that we should stop pandering to tourists. Thank goodness no one listened to me and they brought culture into the building, which was the best thing they could have done in the long run. We should think about all this very carefully, and because we are now preparing to organise an event in Germany and the preparations are going so well, we should be starting to think a little further forward. I must apologise for having pre\\u2010empted the next two stages, because we need to make long\\u2010term plans for our European culture and taking Europe out into the world, and we need to ensure that this impression of Europe is spread much further. As this is the last time I shall be speaking in the European Parliament, I would urge my successors not to forget culture, because it is vitally important. We are a cultural continent and we should remember that this is the most permanent feature that Europe has!\",\n",

A glance backwards would not be out of place, however. Let us consider how past Expos have turned out, and what sort of impression they have left on us. Several members of the Green Group were in Lisbon and felt very disappointed about the whole event. Lessons should be learnt from this.\",\n",
      "        \"The Green Group in the European Parliament therefore maintains a \\u2018constructively critical\\\" attitude towards the Hanover Expo. It is important that the exhibition should be held. As Mr von Habsburg said, what is at stake here is culture.

Countries outside Europe will be included, so that we can draw on cultural knowledge from around the world.\",\n",
      "        \"As far as this particular Expo is concerned, there are some purely budgetary issues to bear in mind, as the Committee on Budgets has pointed out. One aspect is the fact that a huge amount of money is being spent on this exhibition. Appropriations for the European campaign to combat violence against women come under the same budget item. I trust that resources for the latter will not be eaten up by the Expo. My personal opinion is that the campaign on violence against women is actually more important from a future perspective than this exhibition.\",\n",

I myself find the range a little narrow, nonetheless, and am not one hundred per cent sure that the EU should be getting involved in such an event. Yet I believe in the end that the Green Group should support the idea of taking the project forward. In parallel, however, we need a thorough evaluation of exhibitions of this kind. Lessons can then be learnt for future occasions.\",\n",

He has been very successful in fighting for this in his time in the European Parliament, for which I congratulate him. The world exhibition in Hanover is to run from 1 June to the end of October 2000, in other words about a year before euro notes and coins come into circulation. The whole world will be there, as millions of visitors converge on Hanover not just from the 15 Member States, but also from the rest of the globe. One hundred and seventy countries and 14 international organisations are to exhibit, so it is important for Parliament, the Commission and the Council to start thinking now about the meetings they could organise, because a visit to the world exhibition should also primarily involve meeting up with other people, holding conferences and reaching agreements. It is an ideal platform for us in Europe, and it is one that we should exploit to the maximum.\",\n",
      "        \"As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I would also urge that we should hold our interparliamentary meetings there, for example. Hanover has an extremely modern conference centre which is right there on the exhibition site, and it has excellent infrastructure with full interpreting facilities. It would be a good opportunity to show the rest of the world outside Europe the possibilities that Europe has for the future.\",\n",

      "        \"Ferrer (PPE). \\u2013 (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the European textile and clothing sector is currently being battered by massive and abnormally cheap imports from economic areas that are either in the grip of a serious recession or whose own traditional markets have been closed to them. This is what is happening with the countries of South\\u2010East Asia, Central Asia, the former Soviet republics and the Baltic republics. In addition to this, there is the unprecedented increase of imports from Turkey due to the closure of the Russian market and Turkey\\\"s industrial capacity, which has expanded dramatically over the past five years.\",\n",
      "        \"As a result of such massive imports, which scarcely cover the cost of the raw material, many European textile companies are currently recording losses and their survival is threatened. This is seriously jeopardising a number of jobs.\",\n",
      "        \"The unfair competition faced by this sector \\u2013 a sector that includes the production of fibres, threads and cloth and also the finished products \\u2013 is getting worse. And it is getting worse because of the tariff and non\\u2010tariff barriers, as all the rules established within the World Trade Organisation prevent the sector from having access to the markets of countries such as India, the United States or even Turkey. It is as if these rules only applied to the Community\\\"s markets, which these countries and their products can access freely.\",\n",
      "        \"This imbalance is heightened by the vast array of preferential agreements that the Union has already signed, or is about to sign, with third countries, at a time when the announcement of a new round of multilateral negotiations is casting a doubt over the advisability of these bilateral agreements. The result of the combination of these negative elements is that European businessmen in the textile sector feel that there was little use in investing significantly, as they did, in high technology and ambitious restructuring to modernise their business and in specialising in quality, fashion, design and the European trade mark.\",\n",
      "        \"Despite having taken steps to be able to successfully meet the challenge of international competitiveness, the textile sector does not have the weapons it needs to defend itself when faced with unfair competition. For this reason, I would urge the Commission to adopt whatever measures are necessary to put an end to the unfair competition to which this sector is subjected. In this way, we could guarantee full compliance with the commitments made by all the parties in the framework of the World Trade Organisation.\",\n",
      "        \"I am thinking specifically of the trade defence instruments available to the European Union to eliminate trade barriers affecting Community products. I am also thinking of the safeguard measures provided for in the Uruguay Round agreements, which the Commission should perhaps adopt.\",\n",
      "        \"However, in the resolution on the Commission\\\"s communication on the textile and clothing sector, and in the actual plan of action that the Commission then drew up, there is already a series of proposals along these lines. What is happening is that these proposals are not materialising, and if they are not urgently promoted, an large part of a sector which is firmly established in European industry and which, above all, provides many jobs, could disappear.\",\n",
      "        \"Therefore, Commissioner, I would ask you to tell Commissioner Brittan how urgent it is to adopt measures to protect our textiles sector in a fair and faithful manner. On the one hand, this protection should be justified and should comply with some of the provisions and requirements set out in the rules of the World Trade Organisation. On the other hand, it should come under the legislation that the European Union itself has drawn up to govern its trade with third countries and with developing countries. I hope that the Commission will bear this in mind and will address this problem which affects so many jobs.\",\n",

      "        \"Moniz (PSE). \\u2013 (PT) Mr President, during the parliamentary term now drawing to a close, we have frequently discussed textiles and clothing. There has certainly been proportionately more talk than action. Nevertheless, some positive things have been achieved, above all as regards the Commission\\\"s approach to this sector. Previously, the textiles and clothing sector were viewed with suspicion, being regarded as uncompetitive and the province of third world countries. That is to say, it was regarded as a marginal sector doomed to fade away because of an attitude of conformism and fatalist determinism which would inevitably lead to millions of workers losing their jobs, just when the European Union had chosen to give priority to the fight against unemployment.\",\n",
      "        \"As discussion and analysis of the situation has progressed, there has been a significant change in the attitude towards textiles. Fortunately, this sector has come to be viewed as one of the most competitive and innovative, and it has been recognised that it is one of the most labour\\u2010intensive sectors and is therefore potentially an effective tool in the fight against unemployment. I personally am satisfied that I have to some extent been able to contribute to this new perception of the textiles and clothing sector.\",\n",
      "        \"But many things still need to be put on a firm footing. The plan of action announced should not just remain on paper as a list of good intentions. The specific support measures needed for SMEs should be progressed without delay. The European Union should be firm in calling for strict compliance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation and the Textile Agreement, in particular the timetable for liberalisation, controls on dumping and fraudulent practices, access to third country markets and restrictions on bilateral agreements.\",\n",
      "        \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five years ago I started my membership of the European Parliament by raising the problems of the textiles and clothing sector. I am concluding my participation in this final part\\u2010session of the European Parliament on the same subject, more convinced than ever of the need to defend this sector and more confident about its future. In my own country, where this sector accounts for 25\\u2009% of jobs in processing industries and 30\\u2009% of exports, where there are regions that are almost entirely dependent on it, with a consequent impact on the life of most families, thousands of workers and employers are viewing the future with hope and anticipation, but also with many doubts and fears. We must show ourselves worthy of their confidence, dedication and hard work, and their willingness to continue demonstrating their faith by investing in a sector which involves risk but undeniably has a future as an integral part of the Europe of social responsibility and solidarity that we wish to see.\",\n",

The European industry believes that recent imports from a number of third countries, especially from Asia, were made at very low prices. On 3 May, representatives of the European industry met with my colleague Sir Leon Brittan to explain the situation.\",\n",
      "        \"At present the Commission is in the process of establishing, together with the industry, the facts regarding import flows and prices. Once the facts have been established the best course of action can be determined. If it shows that there have been unfair trade practices such as dumping or subsidisation causing injury to the European industry, the European anti\\u2010dumping and anti\\u2010subsidies legislation provides for means to deal with this situation.\",\n",
      "        \"At the meeting of 3 May Sir Leon Brittan assured the European industry that if there was evidence of such unfair trade practices the Commission would examine very seriously any complaint made by the industry. It would then take appropriate action.\",\n",
      "        \"As regards the situation under the relevant international agreements, we have to keep in mind the following. Firstly, for WTO members, the agreement on textiles and clothing (the ATC) already provides for quantitative restrictions on imports from a number of third countries, including countries in South\\u2010east Asia. The Commission ensures that these limits are respected, and there is no evidence that the recent imports have exceeded the quantitative ceilings. In addition, the ATC provides for a transitional safeguard instrument. According to this agreement new quantitative restrictions can be introduced when it can be demonstrated that increased imports seriously damage the domestic industry or threaten to do so. These actions are subsequently scrutinised in the WTO.\",\n",
      "        \"Secondly, for a number of non\\u2010WTO members, bilateral textiles agreements fix quantitative limits. In addition, for imports that are not under quota, reference ceilings are set. These are percentage limits of the previous year's imports as a share of total Union imports. Once these reference ceilings are reached the imposition of a new quantitative limit may be requested.\",\n",
      "        \"Finally, in response to the question regarding the positions expressed by third countries in preparation for the forthcoming round of the WTO negotiations, I would like to say the following. Some developing countries which are WTO members would indeed be interested in amending the agreement on textiles and clothing in order to speed\\u2010up the liberalisation of all quantitative restrictions, presently due to be completed on 1 January 2005. Nevertheless the Commission does not advocate this idea. Such an acceleration of the liberalisation timetable would also cause immense difficulties for the second major textiles importer, the United States.\",\n",

      "        \"I have received two motions for resolutions to wind up this debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5).(1)\",\n",
      "        \"Gas\\u00f2liba i B\\u00f6hm (ELDR). \\u2013 (ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you mentioned, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform party had in fact tabled a motion for a resolution but, in the light of those tabled by both the Group of the European People\\\"s Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, there is no reason why we should not support these resolutions. That is why we have withdrawn our motion.\",\n",
      "        \"In truth, we are returning to an issue that we have dealt with on previous occasions. We are calling for positive action from the Commission to ensure that international trade practices relating to products of the textile industry are dealt with appropriately. We are trying to ensure that trade is conducted in accordance with the rules agreed on in the respective international agreements applied by the World Trade Organisation.\",\n",
      "        \"We have adapted our position not only on the textiles industry but also on the European system of production in general in order to respond to the need for the sector to accept the conditions of a global economy and to work to increase its productivity and competitiveness. It must be restructured so that our products and services are sufficiently accepted in a global economy to enable them participate fully in the international markets. As a result of this increased competitiveness, European industry and services will be able to grow and will therefore also be able to create more jobs. This is the general approach we are also applying to the textile industry.\",\n",
      "        \"Therefore, our position is not a protectionist one. It is a position that will allow us to comply fully with the agreed international trade practices. The events of recent months, particularly in Asia \\u2013 which Commissioner Gradin mentioned \\u2013 are of great concern since the very positive effort made by the textile industry to become more modern and competitive and to have the best possible position and share of the international market may be ruined in a very short space of time.\",\n",
      "        \"Massive imports under inadequate conditions from various areas, including Asia, could ruin the industry\\\"s opportunities. These imports worry us and I welcome Mrs Gradin\\\"s specific comment on this matter. I must stress that this industry has made considerable efforts to adapt. What is more, it would be unfair to put at risk one of the industries that creates most jobs in the European Union.\",\n",
      "        \"Souchet (I\\u2010EDN). \\u2013 (FR) Mr President, I am very pleased that my last speech in this parliamentary term relates to an important sector, the European clothing and textile industry, which has a predominantly female workforce, a large number of SMEs, often in rural areas, and a future which is largely dependent on the application of fair trading rules.\",\n",
      "        \"In the absence of any positive measures by the Commission, whose action plan to make the sector more competitive we examined in 1998 but has not been followed up in practice, some Member States such as France, Spain and Portugal have taken steps to curb the exodus of jobs to third countries. In France, a textile sector plan which reduced the social charges that were a burden on wages has enabled 35 000 jobs to be saved, not to mention indirect employment.\",\n",
      "        \"The Commission then decided to get tough, not against those countries which refused to introduce social and environmental clauses in world trade rules, but against the Member States. It considered that reductions in social charges could distort competition between European producers, and it declared France\\\"s textile sector plan to be illegal, demanded impossible repayments from firms and blocked the extension of this job\\u2010saving measure to other sectors.\",\n",
      "        \"This approach needs to be changed. We should only allow into the Union products from third countries where operators comply with the ILO social rules relating to working conditions, working hours and child labour, until such time as the Union applies these rules as part of the package of international agreements it is negotiating and, in particular, the WTO negotiating rounds. It is unfair competition against European businesses that the Commission should be attacking, not the Union\\\"s own firms.\",\n",
      "        \"In conclusion, I would refer to the concern generated by Mr Prodi\\\"s first statements on this subject, which suggested that he has a very ideological notion of competition and regards any regulating or corrective measures taken by a Member State as tantamount to distorting competition. Would he regard Sir Leon Brittan as dangerously \\u2018dirigiste\\\"? This is not the way to help European industries and the families they support to meet international competition on a level playing field.\",\n",

Mr Moniz also talked about fraudulent practices. Let me tell you one. A country which had the right to import shirts but not piece\\u2010good textiles got round the rules by importing shirts with tails 15 metres long \\u2013 and they got away with it.\",\n",
      "        \"Europe may lead in the textile fashion industry but we must have a basic manufacturing industry in order to support it. Europe may well lead also in the design and techniques of textile machinery but there again we need to have a home market for such products. I mention friction\\u2010spinning, which was as a fairly recent invention in Europe. Instead of using it to make textiles more profitable for Europe we actually sold the technique abroad. We made the profit of our invention once.\",\n",
      "        \"We need to support developing nations by having bilateral treaties with them in order that they can have a market for their goods. I have no quarrel with that at all, but if we are going to have these bilaterals the Commission should be called upon to draw the lines very clearly and make sure they are properly controlled.\",\n",
      "        \"R\\u00fcbig (PPE). \\u2013 (DE) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Ferrer, because I think that this is an extremely important initiative. When sectors are in crisis, we must always ensure that we take the right measures in good time. It is crucial that we should prepare for the WTO negotiating round in Seattle, and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I have always insisted that we should clearly identify the salient points here and that our main concern is access to third markets. We must specifically ensure that these markets are opened up to us and that fair conditions are applied.\",\n",
      "        \"We also need to consider incentives in export marketing. We must see to it that firms are able to offer their goods internationally so that Europe can be presented as a powerful force. Another very important point is that we must ensure that a lighter burden is placed on SMEs in particular. This is an issue to which I personally am very committed. We have more than 16 million SMEs in the European Union, and they need to be given greater help and consideration here in the House in future.\",\n",

      "        \"You all know that in order to weave a basket to hold our political activity, we need many willow branches and these branches are the officials who help us. Therefore, allow me, albeit briefly, to express my thanks to the various groups involved, beginning with the ushers. The ushers, ladies and gentlemen, achieve a marvellous mix of discretion and service without any degree of servility. They respond to any of our requests for help. I believe that we should show our appreciation for their silent and subtle company with great enthusiasm.\",\n",

The first of these is the translators, who survive the reams of pages we throw at them everyday without being exhausted or overcome by such a vast quantity of pages. An average of four thousand pages are produced by the translation service every day. I believe it is only fair to express our gratitude for the rapidity and quality of their work. And, as I cannot mention them all by name, allow me to express our thanks via the Director\\u2010General of Translation and General Services, Mr Wilson.\",\n",

      "        \"And there are more survivors to be thanked: the interpreters. The interpreters manage not to choke on the rapid speeches we cobble together in the few seconds the President may give us if we are lucky. They also work hard to turn our rambling speeches, which are sometimes difficult to understand, into something coherent. Therefore, because they have survived, and because they have helped us so much, we thank them.\",\n",

      "        \"We should also like to thank those whom we do not see every day but whom we see traces of every day, that is, those who produce the Session News, the document that briefly tells us about the sitting. In the inscrutable jungle created by the number of issues we deal with in the House, they are able to choose the appropriate species and tree on every occasion. I should also like to pass on our thanks to them for their work on selecting the right aspects.\",\n",

This has made my work a great deal easier and I should like to thank him from the bottom of my heart.\",\n",

Ladies and gentlemen, our political activity does not move at a frenzied pace, but we could compare it to a train, not a high\\u2010speed train but a goods train. Yet trains do not move forward if there are no rails and these rails are what stop us from coming off the tracks. On many occasions, I have felt that these rails were guiding me along the right track and making my work easier.\",\n",

From an emotional standpoint, there is a Spanish folk song that could express the way I feel at the moment. I am not going to sing it but I will recite the lyrics. Of course, this is a challenge for the interpreters because it obviously rhymes in Spanish. Let us see if they are capable of making it rhyme in every language: \\u2018They say goodbyes are not sorrowful, they say goodbyes are not sorrowful, say that to him who has said farewell, say that to him who has said farewell\\\".\",\n",

We are saying goodbye to one another and we know that we will go down diverging paths and that there will be separate adventures for those we have met day after day in this House. But I must say that the hint of sadness can be compensated for, firstly, by reflecting on what we have done. We can consider two things and the first of these is the satisfaction of a job well done. Ladies and gentlemen, we can be satisfied with a job well done every day, and even on Fridays, and we can say this without being smug and with the peace of mind and conviction we have when stating something we are absolute sure of.\",\n",
      "        \"The second thing that makes up for the hint of sadness, ladies and gentlemen, is the fact that we know that this is not the end: this great celebration of democracy celebration will help it continue. As Mr Medina Ortega said, many of you have been lucky enough to have democracy handed to you as if it were completely natural and you value it just as naturally. Some of us have had to fight for this democracy. Therefore, every time there is an election, irrespective of the outcome for us as individuals, it is a celebration. It is a reason to be happy because we are safe in the knowledge that nothing is above the will of the people when it comes to choosing their representatives.\",\n",

We have gradually moved from sectoral directives regulating various activities to a horizontal approach based on the principle of mutual recognition and two key directives from 1989 and 1992.', 'Clearly, I support the proposals to repeal the sectoral directives. These were supposed to be directives on liberalisation, but in fact they involved various measures that were intended to be transitional but which went on for much longer than necessary, inevitably producing restrictions on freedom of movement and freedom of establishment.', 'I am also in favour of improving and consolidating the general systems for the recognition of qualifications. Although there is fairly satisfactory provision in law for the recognition of qualifications, it is not adequately translated into practice, and Europe\"s citizens still face too many problems when they try to use their professional qualifications and experience in other Member States. I know what I am talking about, because I have heard stories from many young French students wanting to work in Belgium, particularly in the medical field, about the rejections they have faced. Another even more flagrant example of discrimination is the situation of foreign language assistants at universities in Italy, which everyone has heard about.', 'I think these kinds of situations are extremely serious. They are worrying not just because of their effect on the free movement of people and freedom of establishment, but above and beyond that because they are a threat to European citizenship. How can we expect Community nationals to feel any sort of sense of belonging to the European Union if, in their everyday lives or in doing something as natural as looking for work, they are rejected just because they come from one Member State or another? The problem is a very complex one, I know.', 'This is why we need to deal with it, so that it is easier for workers to move around within the European Union. The recognition of qualifications is one way of going about this, and the proposal we are considering today is a step in the right direction.', '- Malangré Report (A4-0234/99)', 'Bru Purón (PSE). – (ES) Madam President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Malangré because I believe that it is of great importance and that its content is extremely sound.', 'The last committee report for this parliamentary term confirms the old adage of ‘last but not least\".', 'It responds to a pressing need, and the lack of attention it has received until now is at odds with the intensive harmonisation achieved in so many aspects of commercial law, from company law to some specific points on insolvency, such as deposit‐guarantee schemes for trouble‐stricken credit institutions.', 'The lack of minimum rules for insolvency proceedings has enormous repercussions for the Union\"s territory as it means that the single market is being built without a roof.', 'Mr Malangré\"s proposal is based on Article 65 of the EC Treaty, as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty, and I support it.

Potato starch', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system for the production of potato starch (COM(99)0173 – C4‐0214/99‐99/0088(CNS)).', 'Sonneveld (PPE). – (NL) Madam President, alongside its decision on compensation for the reduction in the price of cereals, the Agriculture Council also adapted the compensation paid for the production of starch potatoes. It was agreed to fix the compensation for potato growers, given solely in the form of hectare premiums, at a higher level than the Commission had proposed, provided that the number of hectares was reduced accordingly, so that the overall decision would be budget‐neutral in relation to the original Commission proposal. This could only be achieved by reducing the national potato starch quotas by an agreed percentage, albeit in an adapted form, with the larger producers giving up more than the smaller.', 'The Council and the Commission rightly called for the European Parliament to take a decision on the compensation and the potato starch quotas simultaneously, simply as a matter of good management. If we approve this Commission proposal on reducing the quotas, we shall be making the growers\" incomes a little more secure; otherwise they would have been hit particularly hard by the new policy. In certain areas, the production of starch potatoes is a vital concern. The quota proposal, in conjunction with the decision on compensation for starch potato growers, has no effect whatsoever on the competitive position of the processing industry – in actual fact the production of potato starch is being slightly reduced, so the producers of other starches can hardly object to that.', 'Madam President, I have always been proud that we have consistently succeeded in the CAP in finding sensible ways of linking the interests of primary producers and processors, while at the same time giving equal weight to the interests of consumers and taxpayers. The potato starch sector shows the successful operation of the CAP in a nutshell. It is a good example of an extremely dynamic and inventive sector which offers prospects for the non‐food use of agricultural crops. I would like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation in continuing the development of what is an extremely well‐constructed policy.', 'Olsson (ELDR). – (SV) Madam President, potato growing is a significant and promising area of agriculture, with its strong potential for new openings. Sweden has a fairly sizeable potato sector. Our negotiations for membership of the Union coincided with the dying days of alcohol production using potato starch. Now that this activity has ceased, potato growing – for the purposes of industrial starch production – has had to be cut back considerably. This in turn has led to problems for farmers in areas where the land is suited to such crops.', 'A new regulation is now being proposed, under which quotas will be reduced. The reductions will, however, be somewhat lower for countries with low‐volume quotas. I find this a satisfactory solution. It is certainly better than it might have been. I have no objections; in fact, I applaud the proposal. What I would like to stress is the special value of potato starch as a raw material for industry. It is very good for paper manufacturing and there is scope for using it in many new sectors. This is the type of product that should be at the heart of our future investment and development strategies for agriculture.', 'van Dam (I‐EDN). – (NL) Madam President, the Commission proposal to reduce the production quotas for potato starch forms an integral part of the Agenda 2000 package approved in Berlin. It is therefore a good idea for us to deal with it as a matter of urgency today.', 'The regulation of the market in potato starch is closely linked to the regulation of the market in cereals, and rightly so, since potato starch producers are largely operating in the same market as the cereal starch industry. It is therefore extremely important that the subsidies for potato starch should be kept closely in line with the level of aid for cereals.', 'The Commission\"s original proposals seriously affected the balance between potato starch and cereal starch and would have had disastrous consequences for the incomes of potato starch producers. The Commission wanted to pay compensation of only 44\\u2009% of the price reduction, but the Council rightly corrected this by increasing the income premiums to 75\\u2009% of the price reduction. To keep this budget‐neutral, the Council linked this decision to the regulation reducing the quotas, a solution that the sector can live with.', 'A reduction in the quotas is also very much in line with the current supply and demand situation on the potato starch market. A few years ago, the European quota was increased for political reasons. The new Germany was allocated a reserve of 110 000 tonnes, while the most recent Member States got a quota of almost 170 000 tonnes. All of this led to overproduction on the European market.', 'In short, the proposal to reduce the quotas deserves our full support. It enables potato starch producers to be offered reasonable compensation for the price reduction, and it is a decision which the current market situation also justifies.', 'Mulder (ELDR). – (NL) Madam President, I had the opportunity earlier in the week to tell the House how important it was to deal with this proposal this week. It is entirely logical that we should vote on the potato starch sector in the same week that we have voted on Agenda 2000. My group believes that potato starch production is of enormous economic importance in certain areas of Europe, which is why it is absolutely vital that the balancing premium should be maintained. We think that potato starch and cereal starch should in principle always receive the same payments.', 'The Commission proposal to reduce the production quotas and increase the compensation payments for potato starch seems like a good idea, mainly because future developments on the world market could yet take us by surprise. I also think it is important that the Commission should ensure that the compensation payments are made directly to the farmers, if at all possible. If there are fewer middle‐men, there is less chance that money will be used for other purposes, so we must ensure that wherever possible the payments go directly to the farmers.', 'Finally, I would like to say something this morning in support of the development of new technologies. There are a number of technological developments that would make potato starch an ideal sector to promote. I think the Commission needs to pursue an active policy here and should say that it is compulsory to use certain agricultural products in the interests of the environment. This would create a new market for such products and would also be good for the environment.', 'Gradin, Commission. ‐ Firstly I would like to express my appreciation for your acceptance of the urgency procedure for this proposal. Parliament is aware that the proposed reduction of the potato starch quota is very much linked to Agenda 2000. Only yesterday Parliament expressed a positive opinion on the Agenda 2000 package. This includes price reductions and compensation for both cereals and starch potatoes.', 'The compensation for starch potatoes was set at a higher level – 75\\u2009% – as compared to cereals – 48\\u2009%. The potato starch sector fears that a lower compensation would endanger its raw material position. The sector accepts a quota reduction in return.', 'The proposal for quota reduction before us fully neutralises the budget impact of the higher compensation rate.', 'President . – Thank you, Mrs Gradin.', 'The debate is closed.', 'We shall now proceed to the vote.', '(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)']}, {'topic': '3. Hannover 2000', 'paragraphs': [\"President . – The next item is the report (A4‐0195/99) by Mr Hoppenstedt, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ‘EXPO 2000 Hannover' (COM(99)0131 – C4‐0153/99).\", 'Hoppenstedt (PPE), rapporteur. – (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, when the House discussed Expo 2000 in 1990, Venice was still being mooted as a possibility. It was made clear that it would be tantamount to a natural disaster if Venice was chosen to host the exhibition. At the time, and without realising, of course, that I would be speaking as the rapporteur on the last day of this five‐year parliamentary term, I said that if Venice was not going to be considered, Hanover should be Europe\"s representative to compete against Toronto. We know the outcome. Today, some ten years later, we are voting on how Europe is to participate.', 'There is quite a background to this, of course, because for the last 18 months we, and I myself in particular, have been working to move this whole project forward so as to ensure that there is adequate funding for the European Union to be represented at Hanover, and that is by no means an easy task, as you know. This was why we made such a push last year for the 1999 budget, and thanks to all those colleagues who recognised how important it was for the European Union to take part in Hanover, particularly in the year 2000, it was voted through. I would like to thank all those responsible.', 'I was entrusted with the report in March 1998, not March 1999 as it says here, and since then quite a lot has happened. However, the report itself has appeared rather late in the day. This was because the Lisbon World Exhibition was also important for the European Union and the Commission was very much taken up with it. But it was not too late, because the European Union will be in one of the Expo General Commissariat\"s pavilions and will have an excellent position at the head of the European Boulevard near the Plaza. I think the European Union has a good chance of attracting a large number of visitors. As I have said in my report, we do not want the entrance to the European Union to be through the back door to some building or other. No, the European Union must be open to all spectators, and this is what we have achieved through our work together. If we can look forward to a total budget of some EUR 15 million, including the 2000 budget, then it is all thanks to the efforts of our colleagues. And we need the money, because this pavilion looks both back to the past and forward to the future. The theme in Hanover is ‘Humankind – Nature – Technology\", depicted in various imaginative ways, and what institution could be in a better position than the European Union to bring together all the various ideas from around the world and in the Member States, and to disseminate these ideas to give new impetus for the future?', 'I think that we have also been quite successful in having a square near the European pavilion or the European exhibition named after Robert Schuman as an indication of how important Robert Schuman was for the development of Europe, and to have a square that will remain in use in the future. The exhibition centre and buildings will not be disappearing, but are to remain as a living centre in Hanover and the European Union.', 'There is another European element in the European Union\"s exhibition on the theme of ‘Humankind – Nature – Technology\": the euro. The euro will be featured as one of the most recent developments that is of enormous importance for the future in particular, and we have arranged with the relevant bodies, including through requests made by our committees here in the House, to be able to use the euro as an electronic currency. I think that it is important for the many millions of visitors to be able to use the euro and to explain to other people how it will work in future.', 'I think that everyone will pull together on this, including in the future, and since I will no longer be here in Parliament, I would ask Doris Pack, Paul Rübig and others to ensure that it is a success.', 'As I have said, I will not be returning to Parliament, and I should like to thank all those colleagues who have worked so closely with me in the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Culture, especially on these topics that are so important for the future. I should also like to thank the interpreters sitting in their booths, who have communicated our activities here to others. My thanks go to everyone, and I hope to see you again in some other arena in the future!', '(Applaus)', 'Elchlepp (PSE). – (DE) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Hoppenstedt for all his hard work on this issue, and we all hope that Hanover will be a huge success. It is extremely important for the European Union to be involved in an event like Expo 2000, which will attract enormous attention from the media and the public. It is important to present an image of Europe for inward consumption, for the Union\"s own citizens, but also outwardly, for visitors from around the globe.', 'The EU must get closer to the people in its activities, raising its profile among passing trade, as it were, and the Expo is an ideal forum for this. In the Committee on Culture too we have repeatedly stressed that the exhibition should not just show Europe\"s economic successes, but should also illustrate the European Union\"s cultural diversity and in particular its successful programmes. I would also urge – and this is addressed to the organisers of the exhibition – that Parliament should be able to demonstrate its independent role in initiating these programmes, and it should be kept entirely separate from the Commission both in the pavilion and in the budget for the event.', 'Finally, I should also like to take the opportunity to urge the Council once again not just to be proud of our cultural achievements here, but to ensure that there is sufficient funding for the programmes, because there is absolutely no point in getting the public interested in all these wonderful programmes that the European Union organises if the level of funding is just a joke.', 'von Habsburg (PPE). – (DE) Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Hoppenstedt most sincerely for his excellent report, which I have followed with great interest – not so much the exhibition in Hanover as the problems that it has generated. I am also glad that Mr Elchlepp spoke on the subject, for the simple reason that he too produced a wonderful report on an earlier occasion which I still remember with pleasure. I would like to thank him once again for that report.', 'Like any exhibition, the Expo in Hanover will be very important if it is used for the right purpose, as Mr Hoppenstedt underlined. But I would also like to look a little further forward, because there will be other exhibitions in future, and we should be starting to think now about things that will be vital for these future events. Time and again the vital cultural dimension is missing, as Mr Hoppenstedt rightly said, yet this is one of Europe\"s great strengths, and we should focus more attention on the cultural side of things instead of selling it short.', 'Secondly, we should remember that we have not always done ourselves justice here, particularly at exhibitions. As the 2005 Expo is, I am delighted to say, to be held in Nagoya in Japan, I would point out that the exhibition in Osaka led to a number of scandalous bureaucratic blunders, when they built the Europe pavilion but refused to put up the Coudenhove‐Kalergi statue. After a wave of protests the European Community, as it was then, explained that it could not afford it. Then came the most shameful thing of all – the Japanese themselves bought a very fine Coudenhove‐Kalergi statue for the pavilion. This also reminds me of something that happened here in this very building with a statue that was removed by the bureaucrats and has now been returned. We should think of our own roots, and when we go to Japan in particular – and 2005 is not so far away – we should focus on the links we have with these countries.', 'The fact is that we cannot afford to operate just within the European Union: we must also take Europe out into a world that is, whether we like it or not, becoming increasingly globalised and in which partnerships in the Far East are also of vital importance to us. This is why I feel that even today we should all be thinking about what to do in Nagoya. The Asians are, after all, our logical partners. They are a great deal more culturally aware than certain bureaucrats here, and they would be very impressed if we gave our culture pride of place.', 'I remember a Croatian exhibition that we had once that was Croatia\"s first appearance in this building. I was wrong at the time to insist that we should stop pandering to tourists. Thank goodness no one listened to me and they brought culture into the building, which was the best thing they could have done in the long run. We should think about all this very carefully, and because we are now preparing to organise an event in Germany and the preparations are going so well, we should be starting to think a little further forward. I must apologise for having pre‐empted the next two stages, because we need to make long‐term plans for our European culture and taking Europe out into the world, and we need to ensure that this impression of Europe is spread much further. As this is the last time I shall be speaking in the European Parliament, I would urge my successors not to forget culture, because it is vitally important. We are a cultural continent and we should remember that this is the most permanent feature that Europe has!', '(Applaus)', 'President . – Thank you, Mr von Habsburg. Not only is that your last speech in the House, but I would also like to point out the following once again: since 1979 – for 20 years now – you have been one of the Members who are virtually always present on Friday, and you were among the founders of the so‐called Friday club. On behalf of the House, I should like to thank you once more for setting such an example. I also hope that other Members who join us will follow your example and behave likewise.', '(Applaus)', 'Holm (V). – (SV) Madam President, Mr von Habsburg looked ahead in his speech and said that we must look forward to future universal exhibitions. A glance backwards would not be out of place, however. Let us consider how past Expos have turned out, and what sort of impression they have left on us. Several members of the Green Group were in Lisbon and felt very disappointed about the whole event. Lessons should be learnt from this.', 'The Green Group in the European Parliament therefore maintains a ‘constructively critical\" attitude towards the Hanover Expo. It is important that the exhibition should be held. As Mr von Habsburg said, what is at stake here is culture. I am also glad that we are resisting ‘EU nationalism\" by not restricting ourselves to European culture alone. Countries outside Europe will be included, so that we can draw on cultural knowledge from around the world.', 'As far as this particular Expo is concerned, there are some purely budgetary issues to bear in mind, as the Committee on Budgets has pointed out. One aspect is the fact that a huge amount of money is being spent on this exhibition. Appropriations for the European campaign to combat violence against women come under the same budget item. I trust that resources for the latter will not be eaten up by the Expo. My personal opinion is that the campaign on violence against women is actually more important from a future perspective than this exhibition.', \"The theme of the Expo is highly relevant: ‘Humankind – Nature – Technology'. I myself find the range a little narrow, nonetheless, and am not one hundred per cent sure that the EU should be getting involved in such an event. Yet I believe in the end that the Green Group should support the idea of taking the project forward. In parallel, however, we need a thorough evaluation of exhibitions of this kind. Lessons can then be learnt for future occasions.\", 'Rübig (PPE). – (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Hoppenstedt on his last speech, which was very much to the point and summed up what all this is about, namely linking modern technology with nature and mankind. He has been very successful in fighting for this in his time in the European Parliament, for which I congratulate him. The world exhibition in Hanover is to run from 1 June to the end of October 2000, in other words about a year before euro notes and coins come into circulation. The whole world will be there, as millions of visitors converge on Hanover not just from the 15 Member States, but also from the rest of the globe. One hundred and seventy countries and 14 international organisations are to exhibit, so it is important for Parliament, the Commission and the Council to start thinking now about the meetings they could organise, because a visit to the world exhibition should also primarily involve meeting up with other people, holding conferences and reaching agreements. It is an ideal platform for us in Europe, and it is one that we should exploit to the maximum.', 'As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I would also urge that we should hold our interparliamentary meetings there, for example. Hanover has an extremely modern conference centre which is right there on the exhibition site, and it has excellent infrastructure with full interpreting facilities. It would be a good opportunity to show the rest of the world outside Europe the possibilities that Europe has for the future.', 'I would like attention to be focused in particular on the ‘Edu‐tainment Centre\", placing the ‘learning adventure\" – lifelong learning – at the centre of our efforts. We should show what the European Union has already achieved, and we should ensure that all the information is made available on VDUs, on the Internet, on multimedia, for young people, the elderly, in fact anyone interested, in the form of ‘Infotainment\". I think the ‘learning adventure\" is a special challenge, and this modern way of learning is very important and a tremendous opportunity for schoolchildren, students and everyone else.', 'Finally, we must take advantage of the infrastructure around Hanover, which has been developed to a very high standard. I am already looking forward to the opening of this major exhibition.', \"Gradin, Commission. ‐ I should like to congratulate the Committee on Culture, and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Hoppenstedt, for this comprehensive report on Expo 2000 Hannover. In the year 2000, Expo 2000 Hannover will be a major communication event on a world scale. The theme for the exhibition is mankind, nature and technology. The organisers, under the leadership of the Expo Commissioner General, are committed to presenting current and future options on how to achieve a balanced and harmonious coexistence of the theme's three elements.\", \"It is the Commission's intention to ensure the participation of the European Union and its institutions at this important event. This was also outlined in our communication of 18 March. We are pleased to see that all EU Member States will participate in this event. The vast majority will have their pavilions located on the so‐called European boulevard. The EU pavilion would be at the heart of this, just opposite the host country's pavilion.\", 'The aim of Union participation at Expo 2000 is to present the crucial role the European Union is playing, through its institutions, as a forward‐looking, dynamic actor on the world stage at the dawn of the 21st century.', \"The Commission is pleased to note that Mr Hoppenstedt's report gives positive backing to the Commission's intention to organise Union participation at Expo 2000. The report specifically underlines the importance of a coherent and balanced presentation within the Union pavilion.\", \"The Commission agrees with Mr Hoppenstedt that the Union pavilion must present the best possible image of the European Union in the 21st century: a European Union which is democratic, transparent, law‐abiding, socially just, tolerant and culturally diverse. What we strive for is to make its citizens aware of the reality of European integration and of the Union's role in international relations.\", 'It is our aim that such a presentation will be based on the use of the latest interactive multimedia and electronic technology available. This will ensure that visitors, and in particular the younger generation, will have an eye‐catching and thought‐provoking experience.', \"I am pleased to inform you that an architect's competition for the design of the Union's pavilion has now been judged. Its results are due to be announced formally in the EC Official Journal. The companies involved in the competition have also been informed directly. The Commission is responsible for the official coordination of all EU institutions to ensure they participate in a coherent manner in Expo.\", \"I can report to you that such coordination has already begun. The Commission's inter‐service task force, and an interinstitutional working party have been created. The detailed programme of activities and communication strategies is being developed within these two bodies along the lines of the Commission's communication and the Culture Committee's report. Regular reports on the progress of this work will be made to the Culture Committee.\", 'With regard to the budget, an estimated amount of EUR 14 m is proposed for the year 1999‐2000 on budget line B3‐309, Special Annual Events. This budget, which will cover the needs of all EU institutions, is deemed the minimum necessary to finance the proper participation of the Union at the Expo. It will be recalled that a total of EUR 10 m was earmarked on budget line B3‐309/99 in order to finance two activities: Expo 2000 and a European campaign to combat violence against women. In addition to this it is strongly recommended that a further EUR 6.5 m is voted for in the budget for the next year, the year 2000, to complete the Expo 2000 action.', 'The Commission is confident that the interinstitutional cooperation already set in place will produce the necessary positive results to allow the budgetary authority to determine favourably the budget for 2000. The Commission also welcomes the proposal to second Parliament staff to work at Expo 2000. This will be in addition to the Commission staff that will be devoted to this action. The estimated administrative expenditure for this participation is EUR 1.44 m on part (A) of the budget.', \"The Commission looks forward to continuing cooperation with the European Parliament and its services to ensure that the Union's participation at Expo 2000 will be an important event in bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to its citizens.\", 'President . – Thank you, Mrs Gradin.', 'The debate is closed.', 'We shall now proceed to the vote.', '(Parliament adopted the resolution)', 'Svensson (GUE/NGL), in writing. – (SV) I voted against the report. It seems to me that more relevant tasks are being postponed because EUR 15 million are being expended on Expo 2000 in Hanover.']}, {'topic': '4. European textiles market', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:', \"‐ B4‐0338/99 by Mrs Ferrer, Mrs Peijs and Mr Chanterie, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on mass imports of low‐priced textiles;\", '‐ B4‐0339/99 by Mr Moniz, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the mass of cheap imports on the European textile market.', 'Ferrer (PPE). – (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the European textile and clothing sector is currently being battered by massive and abnormally cheap imports from economic areas that are either in the grip of a serious recession or whose own traditional markets have been closed to them. This is what is happening with the countries of South‐East Asia, Central Asia, the former Soviet republics and the Baltic republics. In addition to this, there is the unprecedented increase of imports from Turkey due to the closure of the Russian market and Turkey\"s industrial capacity, which has expanded dramatically over the past five years.', 'As a result of such massive imports, which scarcely cover the cost of the raw material, many European textile companies are currently recording losses and their survival is threatened. This is seriously jeopardising a number of jobs.', 'The unfair competition faced by this sector – a sector that includes the production of fibres, threads and cloth and also the finished products – is getting worse. And it is getting worse because of the tariff and non‐tariff barriers, as all the rules established within the World Trade Organisation prevent the sector from having access to the markets of countries such as India, the United States or even Turkey. It is as if these rules only applied to the Community\"s markets, which these countries and their products can access freely.', 'This imbalance is heightened by the vast array of preferential agreements that the Union has already signed, or is about to sign, with third countries, at a time when the announcement of a new round of multilateral negotiations is casting a doubt over the advisability of these bilateral agreements. The result of the combination of these negative elements is that European businessmen in the textile sector feel that there was little use in investing significantly, as they did, in high technology and ambitious restructuring to modernise their business and in specialising in quality, fashion, design and the European trade mark.', 'Despite having taken steps to be able to successfully meet the challenge of international competitiveness, the textile sector does not have the weapons it needs to defend itself when faced with unfair competition. For this reason, I would urge the Commission to adopt whatever measures are necessary to put an end to the unfair competition to which this sector is subjected. In this way, we could guarantee full compliance with the commitments made by all the parties in the framework of the World Trade Organisation.', 'I am thinking specifically of the trade defence instruments available to the European Union to eliminate trade barriers affecting Community products. I am also thinking of the safeguard measures provided for in the Uruguay Round agreements, which the Commission should perhaps adopt.', 'However, in the resolution on the Commission\"s communication on the textile and clothing sector, and in the actual plan of action that the Commission then drew up, there is already a series of proposals along these lines. What is happening is that these proposals are not materialising, and if they are not urgently promoted, an large part of a sector which is firmly established in European industry and which, above all, provides many jobs, could disappear.', 'Therefore, Commissioner, I would ask you to tell Commissioner Brittan how urgent it is to adopt measures to protect our textiles sector in a fair and faithful manner. On the one hand, this protection should be justified and should comply with some of the provisions and requirements set out in the rules of the World Trade Organisation. On the other hand, it should come under the legislation that the European Union itself has drawn up to govern its trade with third countries and with developing countries. I hope that the Commission will bear this in mind and will address this problem which affects so many jobs.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR GUTIÉRREZ DÍAZ\\nVice‐President', 'President . – Thank you very much, Mrs Ferrer. I wish you all the very best for the future, in spite of the fact that you and I will be competing in the same area in the elections.', 'Moniz (PSE). – (PT) Mr President, during the parliamentary term now drawing to a close, we have frequently discussed textiles and clothing. There has certainly been proportionately more talk than action. Nevertheless, some positive things have been achieved, above all as regards the Commission\"s approach to this sector. Previously, the textiles and clothing sector were viewed with suspicion, being regarded as uncompetitive and the province of third world countries. That is to say, it was regarded as a marginal sector doomed to fade away because of an attitude of conformism and fatalist determinism which would inevitably lead to millions of workers losing their jobs, just when the European Union had chosen to give priority to the fight against unemployment.', 'As discussion and analysis of the situation has progressed, there has been a significant change in the attitude towards textiles. Fortunately, this sector has come to be viewed as one of the most competitive and innovative, and it has been recognised that it is one of the most labour‐intensive sectors and is therefore potentially an effective tool in the fight against unemployment. I personally am satisfied that I have to some extent been able to contribute to this new perception of the textiles and clothing sector.', 'But many things still need to be put on a firm footing. The plan of action announced should not just remain on paper as a list of good intentions. The specific support measures needed for SMEs should be progressed without delay. The European Union should be firm in calling for strict compliance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation and the Textile Agreement, in particular the timetable for liberalisation, controls on dumping and fraudulent practices, access to third country markets and restrictions on bilateral agreements.', 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five years ago I started my membership of the European Parliament by raising the problems of the textiles and clothing sector. I am concluding my participation in this final part‐session of the European Parliament on the same subject, more convinced than ever of the need to defend this sector and more confident about its future. In my own country, where this sector accounts for 25\\u2009% of jobs in processing industries and 30\\u2009% of exports, where there are regions that are almost entirely dependent on it, with a consequent impact on the life of most families, thousands of workers and employers are viewing the future with hope and anticipation, but also with many doubts and fears. We must show ourselves worthy of their confidence, dedication and hard work, and their willingness to continue demonstrating their faith by investing in a sector which involves risk but undeniably has a future as an integral part of the Europe of social responsibility and solidarity that we wish to see.', 'Gradin, Commission. ‐ I should like to reply to the questions by Mrs Ferrer and Mrs Peijs, and by Mr Chanterie and Mr Moniz.', 'On the question regarding recent imports of textiles from third countries into Europe, the Commission is in contact with the European textiles and clothing industry on this issue. The European industry believes that recent imports from a number of third countries, especially from Asia, were made at very low prices. On 3 May, representatives of the European industry met with my colleague Sir Leon Brittan to explain the situation.', 'At present the Commission is in the process of establishing, together with the industry, the facts regarding import flows and prices. Once the facts have been established the best course of action can be determined. If it shows that there have been unfair trade practices such as dumping or subsidisation causing injury to the European industry, the European anti‐dumping and anti‐subsidies legislation provides for means to deal with this situation.', 'At the meeting of 3 May Sir Leon Brittan assured the European industry that if there was evidence of such unfair trade practices the Commission would examine very seriously any complaint made by the industry. It would then take appropriate action.', 'As regards the situation under the relevant international agreements, we have to keep in mind the following. Firstly, for WTO members, the agreement on textiles and clothing (the ATC) already provides for quantitative restrictions on imports from a number of third countries, including countries in South‐east Asia. The Commission ensures that these limits are respected, and there is no evidence that the recent imports have exceeded the quantitative ceilings. In addition, the ATC provides for a transitional safeguard instrument. According to this agreement new quantitative restrictions can be introduced when it can be demonstrated that increased imports seriously damage the domestic industry or threaten to do so. These actions are subsequently scrutinised in the WTO.', \"Secondly, for a number of non‐WTO members, bilateral textiles agreements fix quantitative limits. In addition, for imports that are not under quota, reference ceilings are set. These are percentage limits of the previous year's imports as a share of total Union imports. Once these reference ceilings are reached the imposition of a new quantitative limit may be requested.\", 'Finally, in response to the question regarding the positions expressed by third countries in preparation for the forthcoming round of the WTO negotiations, I would like to say the following. Some developing countries which are WTO members would indeed be interested in amending the agreement on textiles and clothing in order to speed‐up the liberalisation of all quantitative restrictions, presently due to be completed on 1 January 2005. Nevertheless the Commission does not advocate this idea. Such an acceleration of the liberalisation timetable would also cause immense difficulties for the second major textiles importer, the United States.', 'President . – Thank you, Mrs Gradin.', 'I have received two motions for resolutions to wind up this debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5).(1)', 'Gasòliba i Böhm (ELDR). – (ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you mentioned, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform party had in fact tabled a motion for a resolution but, in the light of those tabled by both the Group of the European People\"s Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, there is no reason why we should not support these resolutions. That is why we have withdrawn our motion.', 'In truth, we are returning to an issue that we have dealt with on previous occasions. We are calling for positive action from the Commission to ensure that international trade practices relating to products of the textile industry are dealt with appropriately. We are trying to ensure that trade is conducted in accordance with the rules agreed on in the respective international agreements applied by the World Trade Organisation.', 'We have adapted our position not only on the textiles industry but also on the European system of production in general in order to respond to the need for the sector to accept the conditions of a global economy and to work to increase its productivity and competitiveness. It must be restructured so that our products and services are sufficiently accepted in a global economy to enable them participate fully in the international markets. As a result of this increased competitiveness, European industry and services will be able to grow and will therefore also be able to create more jobs. This is the general approach we are also applying to the textile industry.', 'Therefore, our position is not a protectionist one. It is a position that will allow us to comply fully with the agreed international trade practices. The events of recent months, particularly in Asia – which Commissioner Gradin mentioned – are of great concern since the very positive effort made by the textile industry to become more modern and competitive and to have the best possible position and share of the international market may be ruined in a very short space of time.', 'Massive imports under inadequate conditions from various areas, including Asia, could ruin the industry\"s opportunities. These imports worry us and I welcome Mrs Gradin\"s specific comment on this matter. I must stress that this industry has made considerable efforts to adapt. What is more, it would be unfair to put at risk one of the industries that creates most jobs in the European Union.', 'Souchet (I‐EDN). – (FR) Mr President, I am very pleased that my last speech in this parliamentary term relates to an important sector, the European clothing and textile industry, which has a predominantly female workforce, a large number of SMEs, often in rural areas, and a future which is largely dependent on the application of fair trading rules.', 'In the absence of any positive measures by the Commission, whose action plan to make the sector more competitive we examined in 1998 but has not been followed up in practice, some Member States such as France, Spain and Portugal have taken steps to curb the exodus of jobs to third countries. In France, a textile sector plan which reduced the social charges that were a burden on wages has enabled 35 000 jobs to be saved, not to mention indirect employment.', 'The Commission then decided to get tough, not against those countries which refused to introduce social and environmental clauses in world trade rules, but against the Member States. It considered that reductions in social charges could distort competition between European producers, and it declared France\"s textile sector plan to be illegal, demanded impossible repayments from firms and blocked the extension of this job‐saving measure to other sectors.', 'This approach needs to be changed. We should only allow into the Union products from third countries where operators comply with the ILO social rules relating to working conditions, working hours and child labour, until such time as the Union applies these rules as part of the package of international agreements it is negotiating and, in particular, the WTO negotiating rounds. It is unfair competition against European businesses that the Commission should be attacking, not the Union\"s own firms.', 'In conclusion, I would refer to the concern generated by Mr Prodi\"s first statements on this subject, which suggested that he has a very ideological notion of competition and regards any regulating or corrective measures taken by a Member State as tantamount to distorting competition. Would he regard Sir Leon Brittan as dangerously ‘dirigiste\"? This is not the way to help European industries and the families they support to meet international competition on a level playing field.', 'Kellett‐Bowman (PPE). – Mr President, it is good to see you, the faithful Friday President, taking charge of affairs at the close of the session.', 'I support this cri de coeur from the Europe textile industry. Europe is a big market but it is not a dumping ground and Mrs Ferrer has made a very good case. Mr Moniz also talked about fraudulent practices. Let me tell you one. A country which had the right to import shirts but not piece‐good textiles got round the rules by importing shirts with tails 15 metres long – and they got away with it.', 'Europe may lead in the textile fashion industry but we must have a basic manufacturing industry in order to support it. Europe may well lead also in the design and techniques of textile machinery but there again we need to have a home market for such products. I mention friction‐spinning, which was as a fairly recent invention in Europe. Instead of using it to make textiles more profitable for Europe we actually sold the technique abroad. We made the profit of our invention once.', 'We need to support developing nations by having bilateral treaties with them in order that they can have a market for their goods. I have no quarrel with that at all, but if we are going to have these bilaterals the Commission should be called upon to draw the lines very clearly and make sure they are properly controlled.', 'Rübig (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Ferrer, because I think that this is an extremely important initiative. When sectors are in crisis, we must always ensure that we take the right measures in good time. It is crucial that we should prepare for the WTO negotiating round in Seattle, and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I have always insisted that we should clearly identify the salient points here and that our main concern is access to third markets. We must specifically ensure that these markets are opened up to us and that fair conditions are applied.', 'We also need to consider incentives in export marketing. We must see to it that firms are able to offer their goods internationally so that Europe can be presented as a powerful force. Another very important point is that we must ensure that a lighter burden is placed on SMEs in particular. This is an issue to which I personally am very committed. We have more than 16 million SMEs in the European Union, and they need to be given greater help and consideration here in the House in future.', 'Since I am the last speaker, I should also like to thank the President and his team, who have always worked so very hard here on Fridays. I should also like to thank the President of the European Parliament, Mr Gil‐Robles, for taking my initiatives to eliminate crime in and around the European institutions very seriously; our group chairman Mr Martens for promising not to forget this issue in future in Belgium and to continue to support us; the President‐in‐Office for promising to devote his efforts to this; and finally the Quaestors and the Conference of Presidents, for whom this issue has now become genuinely topical. I am looking forward to seeing a safer Europe in the next parliamentary term.', '(Applaus)', 'President.- Thank you, mr Rübig.', 'The debate is closed.', 'Given that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has withdrawn its motion, we shall proceed to the vote on motion for a resolution B4‐0455/99.(2)', '(Parliament adopted the resolution)', 'Cars (ELDR), in writing. – (SV) I voted against the resolution on the European textile market.

Today, somewhat exceptionally, I myself requested this roll‐call vote and participated in the vote. I abstained in order to remain true to my supposedly institutional attitude.

I hope that your and our example will be carried through to the next term to include Friday as a day when we can count on the presence of 620 Members. Thank you very much indeed and goodbye.', '(Applaus)', 'President.- Thank you - Thank you very much.', 'Mr Medina has the floor on a point of order.', 'Medina Ortega (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, you know that I am usually present for the Friday sittings but that I rarely ask for the floor because we are almost always working so quickly as we have planes to catch and so on. Today, as an exception, because it is the last day of the current parliamentary term and taking into account how early it is, I should like to speak on behalf of the Socialist Group and acknowledge the work you have done as President of the sitting.', 'Furthermore, I should like to point out that for 40 years, Spanish parliamentarians were starved of democracy, and for us the parliamentary institution is extremely important. It is important to you and to me because of our own life experience. I believe that one only values what one does not have. The fact that the European institutions include a Parliament, with all its defects and all its problems, is something that the people of Europe should begin to value. The fact that this Parliament has become a fundamental element of the Community mechanism during this term must be valued. I believe that our task now in the coming weeks must be to convince the people of Europe of how important their participation in the elections is to this Parliament. And I believe that at least those Members who are here today have done everything possible to ensure that our work is not trivial, but that it is important and definitive work in the process of European integration.', '(Applaus)', 'Gasòliba i Böhm (ELDR). – (Catalan) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last sitting of this parliamentary term, I should of course like to add to the thanks expressed by my colleagues Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Habsburg‐Lothringen.

I therefore endorse what Mr Medina and the acting chairman of the Liberal Group have said. Thank you very much and goodbye.', 'Poggiolini (PPE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, I would not wish the Italian language to remain unheard at this moment of farewells. I cannot, much as I would like to, speak Catalan, but nonetheless I would like to thank you and also all the Vice‐Presidents who are not here and have done such sterling work, as well as President Gil‐Robles.', 'We shall be leaving this Chamber, and I believe even those colleagues who are re‐elected will not be returning to it, because a new one has been provided. We are rather sorry to leave it, because this is the historic residence of the European Parliament.', 'I would also like to thank our chairman Mr Martens, whom I can see leaving just now, for staying here right up to the end. Nonetheless, the vice‐chairman, Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten, remains and is a worthy replacement for him. I bid farewell to you all, and would particularly thank you, Mr President, for the great skills and common sense you have shown in chairing our debates.', 'Rosado Fernandes (UPE). – (PT) Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, I would first like to say that I believe your profession as a paediatrician has been a great help to you in understanding many of the issues discussed here in Parliament. Lenin himself referred to leftism as a child illness, and so in this Chamber we find childishness, maturity and longevity. All human life is here. Those of us here on Fridays, this loyal group of survivors of the often hard and tedious work during the week, amongst whom there is a spirit of complicity, have managed to maintain a sense of humour.', 'Humour is a basic requirement here. It has brought cheer to young and old alike – I will not say to children, as there are none here. I would like to thank you on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, and in Portuguese, for the patience, humour and wisdom that has marked everything you have done here. Thank you very much and I wish you every success in your profession. I shall be returning to mine also: five years is a long time in a man\"s life and I do not have many five years to spare for Parliament, so I shall be devoting myself to other causes.', 'Oomen‐Ruijten (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, a number of people have already thanked you, and I would like to join them in doing so. There is one person I would like to mention, whom I refer to in our group as the Friday godfather, the one who always has something to say, and that is Mr von Habsburg. The fact that there are so many of our group here is partly thanks to him. He too is now leaving us. I should like to thank him for the excellent leadership he has shown us all.', '(Applaus)', 'Paasio (PSE). – (FI) Mr President, as this is the last sitting in the first parliamentary term in which Finland has been a fully‐fledged Member of the European Union, I, as a faithful son of the Friday club, would like the Finnish language to be recorded in the verbatim report of the proceedings of this last sitting. We would especially like to thank you, Mr President, for the fact that you were always happy to welcome us Finns in the Finnish language, which you pronounce so elegantly, and for the fact too that you were always ready to guide and encourage us, as we were new to the procedure of this House. Many thanks, and many thanks also go to all of you sitting there on the tribune. The work you have done has been invaluable. Thank you.', 'Lindholm (V). – (SV) Mr President, greetings to you from Nordic parts and from Sweden! On behalf of the Green Group, I should like to join in the chorus of praise heaped upon you today. You have always conducted Friday\"s proceedings in such a friendly way, with great humanity and humour. You have been a fantastic President. Because of you, Fridays have been a high point of the Strasbourg week. Along with everyone else, I wish you all the very best for the future.', 'Virrankoski (ELDR). – (FI) Mr President, I would like to add my thanks to those of Mr Paasio, as, of all those who chair our sittings, you are one of the few who have actually used the Finnish language in carrying out your duties.', 'González Álvarez (GUE/NGL). – (ES) Mr President, it would be terrible if the group that has loyally supported this Vice‐President to the end did not thank him for his work and dedication. What is more, from a personal point of view, he knows we think fondly of him. I hope, however, that he will not use these great complimentary speeches by the whole House to his benefit in the election campaign, as we are in different camps.', '(Laughter)', 'I should like to say how fondly I think of you. Our group has supported you faithfully until the end and you know that, wherever we may be, you will always be remembered.', 'President . – Thank you very much, my good friend Laura. Allow me, in this case, to correct what Laura said slightly: we are not in different camps, we are in the same camp but on different lists.', 'Goerens (ELDR). – (FR) Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to a small point which I think is rather important. Friday is not a normal day either for you or for me. Friday is usually the day when I receive groups of visitors, and I can assure you that as far as the people from my country who have visited the European Parliament are concerned, you are the most popular president of the sitting. I am grateful that you are a candidate in your own country, because in mine you would have been unbeatable. Thank you and good luck for the future.', 'President . – Thank you very much, Mr Goerens. I hope that I will pick up your way of thinking to help me in the difficult journey ahead.', 'Bertens (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, you have always been a very friendly person. Whenever we met in the corridor, you would always ask ‘How is Maastricht getting on?\" Other people thought you were talking about the Maastricht Treaty, but in fact you meant my football club, which was always doing very badly – and still is. But we knew what we meant. Barcelona, on the other hand, is doing very well, but that is because it has eight Dutch players. Thank you very much.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Bertens. Of course, you speak as if you were from Barcelona, because you know that at the moment Barcelona is almost a Dutch team.', 'Gebhardt (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, you seem to be being presented today with a bouquet made up of all the different cultures and languages of our various nations. As someone born a Frenchwoman, I should like to add Germany\"s flower to this bouquet for you to take home in your heart, and I should like to wish you every success in your work for democracy, which is so important.', '(Applaus)', 'Escolá Hernando (ARE). – (ES) Mr President, I was possibly the last Member to join the ‘Friday club\". You are well aware that I came to this House scarcely six months ago. That is a very short time but it is enough for me to have appreciated your work as President and your work in chairing this sitting. In these six months I have missed two Friday sittings and you made sure to remind me of them. I should like to thank you personally and on behalf of the group I represent.', 'Bru Purón (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, as well as thanking and congratulating you, I should like to add to what has been said by Mrs González Álvarez and by you yourself. I should like to say that there is one thing we agree on in terms of parties and lists: we are all on the list of pro‐Europeans. In the past in Spain, being on the list of pro‐Europeans meant being on the black list. Therefore, whether or not you are on the list, whether or not you are in the party, or whether or not you are in this House, I know that both of you, like many of us here today, are in favour of freedom, justice and solidarity.', 'Lenz (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, as someone who has been in Parliament for 20 years, I should also like to congratulate you, together with my colleague Ursula Schleicher, who has also often been a member of the Friday club. It was always a great pleasure to round off a long and difficult sitting – and I was often there at the end, though not always – with a joke, and I hope that the spirit which you have stood for and which several people have reflected in their speeches will continue in the next Parliament. It will be in a different building which will not be as homely; the light will be colder, I think, but I hope that the pleasure, the vision, the cooperation and the humour will remain.', 'Lulling (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, Luxembourgish is sadly not one of the Community\"s official languages, otherwise I would have added it to the bouquet that Mrs Gebhardt talked about. But if I say ‘Villmools merci \", I am sure you will understand, and it would surely not be against the Rules of Procedure just this once to use two words of Luxembourgish, one of which is French anyway.', 'Mr President, I should like to thank you for being in the Chair for almost all the Friday sittings. I regard Friday as a normal working day just like all the rest, and I am extremely sorry that so many of our colleagues are notoriously absent. I have attended every Friday sitting for the past ten years, and if I return – I do not know whether I will, because in my country the people decide, not the parties – I shall maintain the same discipline.', 'I would also like to thank you for being so generous with speaking time. We have sometimes been allowed to have the floor for half or even a whole minute more than the minute officially allocated, so I would thank you most sincerely and hope to see you here again – because you are sure to be re‐elected – not just on Fridays, but on all sitting days.', 'Posselt (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, I should like to thank you not just for being such an excellent leader of our Friday club, as many people have already mentioned, but for something else as well. This morning Mrs Schleicher, who is also a member of the Friday club, said in the Chair at the beginning of the sitting ‘The Rules of Procedure also apply to the Conference of Presidents\". This has inspired me to thank you for being a vice‐president who has always stood up for the rights of individual Members. The Friday club itself consists of people who stand up for the rights of Members, and I very much hope that we will be able to continue to work together on this in the next parliamentary term.', 'Lindqvist (ELDR). – (SV) Mr President, as a member of the ‘Friday Club\", I too would like to say a few words. We must remember that this is not the only club we have. Let us not forget our ‘Questions Club\", over which you have often presided. Several of us are keen users of Question Time. Although attendance tends to be lower on those occasions, you always behave in Friday fashion, in your usual open and friendly way. Thank you so much for the fine times we have shared, Mr President.', 'Gröner (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, I too would like to thank you. I cannot for the moment find the rule that I need in the Rules of Procedure, but I would like to say, finally, that this was a parliamentary term which took Europe a little further forward, but took the European Parliament a great deal further forward. We have three new Member States, and I hope that the Amsterdam Treaty and the excellent spirit that you have generated with your sense of humour will enable us to make considerable progress towards a democratic Europe. I wish all those colleagues who are not coming back every success and good health in the future, and I wish those who are coming back the strength to stand up for a democratic Europe.', 'President . – Thank you, Mrs Gröner. I should like to thank you and all the Members of this House who have spoken.', 'As regards what Mrs Lenz said, if it is not going too far, I believe that her words can be extended to all the Vice‐Presidents.', '***', 'President . – I have received a request for the waiver of Mr Carlos Coelho\"s parliamentary immunity from the relevant Portuguese authorities. Pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure, this request will be passed on to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.', 'I have received requests from the Group of the European People\"s Party to appoint Members to the following committees: Mr Wieland as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights; and Mr Gahler to replace Mr Wieland as a member of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities. Are there any comments? If not, these appointments are approved.', 'Mr Posselt has the floor.', 'Posselt (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, I should like to offer my warmest congratulations to everyone on their appointments.', 'President . – Thank you very much, Mr Posselt. That will be noted in the Minutes.', 'Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.', 'As this is the last sitting in this parliamentary term, I would propose to the House that we derogate from Rule 133(2) and approve the Minutes of the current sitting now. They have been drafted as the debates have taken place. If there are no comments, that is how we shall proceed.', '(The Minutes were approved)', '(3)', 'Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our work. As you are all aware, I usually thank Parliament\"s services for their help during the sittings on behalf of all of you and I am sure I reflect your feelings in doing so. Today, such thanks must be of a special nature. It is not the last time they will be thanked but it is the end of an era.', 'You all know that in order to weave a basket to hold our political activity, we need many willow branches and these branches are the officials who help us. Therefore, allow me, albeit briefly, to express my thanks to the various groups involved, beginning with the ushers. The ushers, ladies and gentlemen, achieve a marvellous mix of discretion and service without any degree of servility. They respond to any of our requests for help. I believe that we should show our appreciation for their silent and subtle company with great enthusiasm.', '(Applaus)', 'We must also thank two groups of survivors. The first of these is the translators, who survive the reams of pages we throw at them everyday without being exhausted or overcome by such a vast quantity of pages. An average of four thousand pages are produced by the translation service every day. I believe it is only fair to express our gratitude for the rapidity and quality of their work. And, as I cannot mention them all by name, allow me to express our thanks via the Director‐General of Translation and General Services, Mr Wilson.', '(Applaus)', 'And there are more survivors to be thanked: the interpreters. The interpreters manage not to choke on the rapid speeches we cobble together in the few seconds the President may give us if we are lucky. They also work hard to turn our rambling speeches, which are sometimes difficult to understand, into something coherent. Therefore, because they have survived, and because they have helped us so much, we thank them.', '(Applaus)', 'We should also like to thank those whom we do not see every day but whom we see traces of every day, that is, those who produce the Session News, the document that briefly tells us about the sitting. In the inscrutable jungle created by the number of issues we deal with in the House, they are able to choose the appropriate species and tree on every occasion. I should also like to pass on our thanks to them for their work on selecting the right aspects.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, we must also thank those who produce the Rainbow every day. I would say that they are like good photographers, who photograph a sunset and improve upon it but make us believe that it is exactly the same. With great subtlety, they often improve upon our speeches. We should also like to thank them.', 'And, lastly, allow me to express my thanks to my friends – indulge me and let me call you my friends – who are here with me today and who have been with me on so many occasions.', 'I am also going to say a few words of special thanks to the Secretary‐General. I personally owe a great deal to the Secretary‐General for his skill and his rigour when it comes to putting forward proposals. This has made my work a great deal easier and I should like to thank him from the bottom of my heart.', 'And I would also like to thank my friends who have helped me. Ladies and gentlemen, our political activity does not move at a frenzied pace, but we could compare it to a train, not a high‐speed train but a goods train. Yet trains do not move forward if there are no rails and these rails are what stop us from coming off the tracks. On many occasions, I have felt that these rails were guiding me along the right track and making my work easier.', 'Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you all from an emotional and a rational standpoint. From an emotional standpoint, there is a Spanish folk song that could express the way I feel at the moment. I am not going to sing it but I will recite the lyrics. Of course, this is a challenge for the interpreters because it obviously rhymes in Spanish. Let us see if they are capable of making it rhyme in every language: ‘They say goodbyes are not sorrowful, they say goodbyes are not sorrowful, say that to him who has said farewell, say that to him who has said farewell\".', 'Ladies and gentlemen, there is a hint of sadness today; we are not going to try to hide it. We are saying goodbye to one another and we know that we will go down diverging paths and that there will be separate adventures for those we have met day after day in this House. But I must say that the hint of sadness can be compensated for, firstly, by reflecting on what we have done. We can consider two things and the first of these is the satisfaction of a job well done. Ladies and gentlemen, we can be satisfied with a job well done every day, and even on Fridays, and we can say this without being smug and with the peace of mind and conviction we have when stating something we are absolute sure of.', 'The second thing that makes up for the hint of sadness, ladies and gentlemen, is the fact that we know that this is not the end: this great celebration of democracy celebration will help it continue. As Mr Medina Ortega said, many of you have been lucky enough to have democracy handed to you as if it were completely natural and you value it just as naturally. Some of us have had to fight for this democracy. Therefore, every time there is an election, irrespective of the outcome for us as individuals, it is a celebration. It is a reason to be happy because we are safe in the knowledge that nothing is above the will of the people when it comes to choosing their representatives.', 'Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we can take solace in the satisfaction of knowing that we will be well represented in the future.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, my friends, I wish you good health and good luck in your future work.']}, {'topic': '5.

You will recall that in the April plenary we passed a resolution in this House inviting Mr Rugova to address the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is proposed that we hold a Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 21‐22 June for the purpose of a hearing with the High Representative. However, it would seem to me at the very least appropriate that we should invite Mr Rugova also to address that committee. What are your comments on that suggestion, and could you convey that idea to the President?', 'President . – Thank you for that suggestion, Mr Spencer. We have all heard that Mr Rugova has arrived in Rome, happily with his family, and I think it is natural for him to come here to Parliament. I shall pass on your proposal to the President, and I do not think there is any obstacle to inviting him to come to Parliament on 21 June.', 'Maes (ARE). – (NL) Mr President, in all the confusion during the vote on the Rothley report yesterday I mistakenly voted in favour in the final vote, when I actually meant to vote against. I would ask you to amend the Minutes to show this. It would not change the outcome of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, but it really was all very confusing. I would specifically request that this should be done if at all possible. I would also ask you to note that I did vote on Amendment No 18 by Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy, but my vote is not shown in the Minutes. I actually voted in favour.', 'President . – We have noted that, Mrs Maes, and it will be recorded in the Minutes.', 'Fabre‐Aubrespy (I‐EDN). – (FR) Mr President, on page 8 of the Minutes, under the heading ‘Approval of the President‐designate of the Commission\", there is a record of Parliament\"s vote approving the designation of Mr Prodi by the Heads of State and Government. It says that the President congratulated the elected President.', 'I think that the wrong terms are used here. In order for there to be an election there needs to be several candidates and a democratic process.

I welcome the suggestion that Dr Ibrahim Rugova, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by this House, should come and address us in June for as long as is necessary.', 'We asked to go to Pristina. The Serbian authorities refused, saying that they could not guarantee our safety, and we had to give in to them. It is good that now all roads lead once more to Rome. Mr Rugova should come, and we should find out what has been happening to him. The important thing is to restore peace to the Balkans and for those people to return to their territory.', \"President . – I think a very broad majority of the House could endorse that, Mr Soulier.

The Committee on Budgets has written to the President advising this should be done by qualified majority because we are handing over a number of powers if we approve this agreement. It will have to be done by qualified majority.', 'I insist, on behalf of many colleagues, that the President circulate a note arguing why he is recommending this should be done on a simple majority.

I spoke to Mr Rugova on the phone last night. I would ask that we be given the opportunity to see him even before the committee meeting in June, because he will be in demand over the next few weeks and, I fear, will be misused by some people. For that reason, I believe it is important that we should grasp the opportunity to speak to him very soon. If you can find a way of making that point to the President, it would certainly suit our purposes. I should be willing to sacrifice a few slots on my electioneering schedule to that end.', 'President . – Thank you for your support for the proposals by Mr Spencer and Mr Imbeni, Mrs Pack.', 'Bianco (PPE). – (IT) Mr President, I had asked for the floor in order to support Mr Imbeni\"s proposal, but Mrs Pack has already spoken now and I agree with her. That is all.', 'Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, I should simply like to remind some of our colleagues, and Mr Elles in particular, that the way the institutions take decisions, in accordance with the well consolidated case‐law of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, is not something we can tamper with. It is a question of law and order and is enshrined in the Treaties. And as far as the Treaties are concerned, unless it is expressly stated, this House takes decisions by simple majority. In addition, there is ample case‐law stating that the acts are what they are and not what any interpretation may make of them. This also applies to the effects such acts may have, no matter how sensibly they may be interpreted.', 'Finally, Mr Elles is well aware that the Committee on Budgets, a well respected and very competent committee, is in no way an internal body with the powers to dictate which majority should be used to take decisions in this House.', 'President . – I will likewise refer your comments to the President of Parliament, Mrs Palacio, who is coming to chair the sitting and the vote at 11 a.m.', '(The Minutes were approved)', '(1)']}, {'topic': '2. Schengen', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the oral question (B4‐0336/99) by Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, to the Council, on Schengen.', 'Voggenhuber (V). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the representative of the Council presidency has not been welcomed by name, so I do not know whom I should be addressing at this moment. But I do hope that a representative is here. Mr President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on behalf of which I speak here, there have been serious concerns that the Council might not manage to arrive at decisions in time to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the European Union and that the relevant legal instruments would then automatically become part of the third pillar. That is why the fact that this agreement has been reached and that the decisions have indeed been taken has been greeted with a degree of relief. That is the good news I am able to give the presidency. The bad news is that the way in which these decisions and stipulations were made has drawn heavy criticism and even protests from the overwhelming majority of our committee, and I hope that the House will share our indignation, because this is a very important matter in terms of parliamentary control and codetermination in the field of internal security.', 'The Amsterdam Treaty itself dealt with the incorporation of the Schengen agreement, the institutional issues, the distribution of powers and the procedural arrangements in an extremely questionable and vague manner, namely by relegating these matters to an additional protocol. I do believe we must dwell on the significance of this line of approach in order to appreciate fully the nature of the criticism voiced by the committee and by Parliament. The incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the European Union is surely the most important and the most complex transformation of international law into the law of the European Union. It lays the foundations on which the freedom of the individual can be enshrined in EU law, it is the means by which the Union can become an area in which freedom, justice and security are guaranteed, and it is certainly the most significant increase of powers in the field of internal security. It is a transfer of power that will have a massive impact on fundamental rights and civil liberties.', 'Let me ask the presidency of the Council at this point how the European institutions, and particularly the elected representatives of the European people, are to explain to the public that such a project can be implemented without involving Parliament, without informing or consulting Parliament. How are we supposed to explain that this Parliament has not even been accorded the right to deliver an opinion, that we have not even received detailed documentation and information about this scheme, and that we now have to discuss it without actually having been briefed on its details?', 'Allow me to voice the view of the absolute majority of the committee by saying that this is not only a matter of the rights of Parliament, important though they may be; one of the roles in which this Parliament has always seen itself is as the advocate of fundamental rights, of civil liberties, of personal rights in the European Union, and it is difficult to serve as the advocate of the European people if we are excluded in this way from Council projects, an exclusion which we believe is contrary to the letter of the Treaty; no doubt we shall have to agree to differ once again on that point, but in any event our exclusion is entirely contrary to the spirit of the Treaties.', \"Perhaps I should also point out that the Council's approach once more raises the question of whether the theory of the Council's indirect legitimacy as a legislative authority stands up to scrutiny in the light of such occurrences, because the European Parliament is not the only legitimate representative body discussing these matters without the aid of documentation and being excluded from the Council's decisions and preparations; as we know, our national parliaments have been informed inadequately and at the last possible moment. In other words, we can no longer speak of genuine parliamentary control in the field of internal security, of police and judicial cooperation. That is the particular protest, the vehement protest, of the committee that I bring to your attention today, and it is not only on behalf of our committee that I call on the presidency of the Council to develop an entirely new culture of cooperation with Parliament in this extremely sensitive area of government authority and power in the domain of civil liberties and fundamental rights.\", 'Schapper, Council. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 May the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, and on that date the Schengen system was incorporated into the European Union framework. The German Presidency has always regarded it as one of our foremost tasks to brief the European Parliament on the progress of the preparations for the integration of the Schengen cooperation arrangements, and I am pleased to have another opportunity to do so today, since the question of information and the form in which it is imparted has been such a crucial issue. Mr Voggenhuber, I shall also deal in detail with your comments on the subject.', \"First of all, I should like to say a few words on the definition of the fruits of Schengen and their place in the EU framework. The discussions that are being held with a view to defining the substance of the Schengen cooperation arrangements and incorporating it into the legal bases of the EC Treaty and the Treaty on European Union have made good progress and are now very close to completion. The relevant draft Council decisions were noted and frozen by the General Affairs Council at its meeting of 26 April. Following yesterday's final deliberations in the Permanent Representatives Committee, the presidency is seeking the adoption of the decisions at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 10 May.\", 'I make no secret of our pride in the fact that the German Presidency has succeeded, in collaboration with its partners, in answering most of the questions relating to the place of the Schengen provisions, questions which remained thorny until the very end and which were affected by a vast range of diverse political considerations. The way is clear now for an extensive examination of the substance of Schengen, which is precisely what the Treaty of Amsterdam requires. It has not been possible, however, to reach an agreement on the place of the provisions relating to the Schengen information system. While a group of Member States has been pressing for the integration of these provisions into both the first and third pillars, a number of others favour incorporation into the third pillar only. A compromise position, which the presidency supports, proposes recourse to the third pillar as far as the establishment and operation of the Schengen information system and most of the notification categories are concerned, whereas notices of refusal of entry visas and the rules on system‐related data protection would also have legal bases in the first pillar.', 'Despite the best efforts of the presidency, a consensus on this point has proved impossible and there is no prospect of such an agreement on the horizon. In this area – and only in this area – the legal fiction in the Schengen Protocol, which provides for the third pillar to serve as the legal basis until further notice, will apply. This, incidentally, will not prejudice the adoption of the decision determining how the legal bases are to be split. I believe that this outcome, which has yet to be finally confirmed by the Council, is acceptable. For key parts of the substance of Schengen, it will prevent innumerable disputes regarding the legal bases on which future developments are to be founded.', 'I should be exceeding my terms of reference if I were to deal with the legal bases of each of the Schengen provisions. But I must point out that, about a week ago, I sent you the drafts of the Council decisions, the aims of which are firstly to define the substance of the Schengen rules and secondly to examine that substance in detail. May I ask you to refer to those two documents for detailed information.', 'Let me now briefly answer the question on the associated status of Iceland and Norway. The association of those countries with the implementation and development of the Schengen provisions will take place on the basis of an association agreement, which is due to be signed quite soon. Now that the Executive Committee of the parties to the Schengen Agreement has had its last meeting, held last week on 28 April, which means that the fruits of Schengen can be defined conclusively, it is also possible to identify the areas in which cooperation with Norway and Iceland should take place in the future. The discussions on this question are almost completed. The presidency expects that the Council will approve the agreement at its meeting on 17 and 18 May and that the agreement can be signed as part of the EEA Council meeting which is being held at the same time.', \"At the heart of the association agreement is the creation, at all levels of the hierarchy of EU authorities, of a joint committee through which Norway and Iceland will play their part in the shaping of decisions. In the Schengen framework, these two countries have been directly involved in the work of the authorities, with the right to express their views but without formal voting rights. A direct transfer of this form of cooperation into the EU framework is not possible. The basic rule is that participation in the work of EU bodies is the sole prerogative of Member States. Other forms of involvement, such as observer status, would not have satisfied Iceland's and Norway's legitimate need to keep contributing to the discussion process on the subjects covered by the Schengen Agreement. This is why the two countries and the Member States have agreed on the creation of a special system of committees, the main aim of which will be to serve as a platform for the discussion with Norway and Iceland of proposals and initiatives for further developing the fruits of the Schengen process.\", 'The joint committee will only have very limited decision‐making powers. These will be confined to procedural matters affecting the joint committee itself and its activities. Substantive decisions on the development of the fruits of Schengen, decisions which Iceland and Norway will have helped to shape, will be taken exclusively by EU bodies, namely the Council and, where appropriate, the Permanent Representatives Committee.', 'In addition to the association agreement I have just described, the draft of which I recently sent to you, the Schengen Protocol provides for the conclusion of another agreement on the legal relationship between Norway and Iceland on the one hand and the United Kingdom and Ireland on the other hand in matters relating to their recourse to the benefits of Schengen. The negotiations on this have begun. I expect that they can be completed within a short space of time.', 'Allow me to say a few words on the integration of the Schengen Secretariat. On 1 May 1999 the Council, acting in accordance with the written consultation procedure, decided to integrate the staff of the Schengen Secretariat into the Secretariat‐General of the Council, and I hope that a line can now be drawn under the recent debates on this subject and that the presidency, the Member States and the staff of the Council Secretariat can turn their full attention once again to the substantive work that confronts us in the remaining two months of the German Presidency.', 'In the course of the decision‐making process, it emerged that some of the Council Secretariat staff are virtually taking to the barricades in opposition to the absorption of the Schengen staff, who have not gone through the customary selection procedure. I have no sympathy with that position, because the incorporation of former members of the Schengen Secretariat has nothing to do with nepotism or favouritism. On the contrary, it serves to safeguard the subsistence of a group of people who have shown great commitment over the years to the Schengen cooperation process and who must not suffer from the integration of Schengen into the EU framework. Moreover, the Union will also benefit from the specialised knowledge and skills of the trained Schengen staff.', 'Let me finish by dealing with the consultation of the European Parliament on the transfer of the Schengen cooperation arrangements into the EU framework. The German Presidency recognises unreservedly that the transfer of the Schengen arrangements into the EU framework is of enormous importance to the future work of the European Parliament, and that Parliament has a legitimate interest in the various steps that have to be taken on the way to integration. Germany has always respected that interest by providing detailed information on developments in the process. Interior Minister Otto Schily, staff of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and I myself have briefed Parliament and its Internal Affairs Committee on several occasions. I might remind you that Mr Schily addressed the House on 14 January and that he spoke to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on 19 November and again on 30 March; I myself was at the meeting of the Internal Affairs Committee on 23 November, and Mr Eisel, who heads the other competent directorate in our department, has also briefed the committee twice during the past week. So I believe we have done all we could to keep Parliament and its committee informed.', 'Nevertheless, I should also point out that we have no statutory obligation to engage in formal consultation on matters concerning the integration of the Schengen cooperation arrangements into the EU framework. The sole basis for the incorporation of Schengen is the Schengen Protocol, which makes no provision for formal consultation. The consultation requirements laid down in the Amsterdam and Maastricht Treaties do not apply to the transfer of the Schengen system. Let me assure you once again, however, that the presidency will continue to keep the European Parliament fully briefed on the state of the integration process.', 'Van Lancker (PSE). – (NL) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement the Council has reached on incorporating the Schengen acquis into the Treaty is yet another of the sort of agreements that Parliament regards with extremely mixed feelings. Of course, it is wonderful that an agreement has been reached, which none of us dared hope would be achieved under the German Presidency. On 14 January this year, we adopted a resolution expressing our concern at the absence of an agreement, which would have meant that the whole of the acquis would have come under the third pillar. So the fact that an agreement has been reached is quite a feat, and I congratulate the German Presidency on it.', 'The agreement also ensures that a considerable number of the provisions of the Schengen acquis , those dealing with the free movement of persons, asylum, immigration and border controls, are now mainly Community issues, which means that Parliament and the Court of Justice will be involved in policy in these fields in future. This too is to be welcomed. However, there are certain elements here that we find very hard to swallow because they are completely contrary to the recommendations that Parliament made in January.', 'First and foremost yet again, Mr President‐in‐Office, there is the role that Parliament has played. It is true that the German Presidency held various discussions with Parliament and that we were kept informed throughout the period of the negotiations, for which we are grateful to the presidency. But you cannot deny that the final documents only reached Parliament on Monday, that Monday was the first chance we had to discuss the final outcome of the negotiations, and that the consultation of Parliament is really just a joke because everything has already been decided. A political agreement has been reached and simply needs to be confirmed by the Council on 10 May.', 'You are quite right. Formally speaking you do not need to consult Parliament, but politically speaking this would not be advisable, since the choice of legal basis when incorporating Schengen into the Treaty will determine how the future acquis is to be developed and what the roles of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice will be. So it is a crucial decision that directly affects Parliament\"s rights, which was why we felt we ought to be consulted, and consulted seriously. We even said in our resolution of 14 January that if this did not happen, Parliament would have to consider bringing a case before the Court of Justice, and I still think that the next Parliament should consider doing this.', 'Mr President‐in‐Office, this is not a matter of injured pride. This is all about democratic control, because Parliament has a number of comments to make on the substance of the agreement too. First, the President‐in‐Office has himself admitted that there is no agreement on the Schengen information system. No agreement is better than just dumping everything under the third pillar, which would have been disastrous, but for the time being the Schengen information system is to remain under the third pillar, and this is a great mistake because the SIS contains a lot of data about immigration, asylum and visas, all of which are areas where enormous problems occur on a daily basis. So I would like to ask the Council what it can do to get us out of this impasse. Incidentally, the protection of personal data is a particularly important issue with the Schengen information system, and we should not forget that the Joint Supervisory Authority produced a highly critical report here. I would therefore urge that a proposal be put forward on the basis of Article 286 providing for an efficient supervisory body to be set up, together with a proposal for the protection of personal data under the third pillar, where there is as yet no such guarantee.', 'Finally, I would also draw your attention to the Commission\"s right of initiative now on the whole of the Schengen acquis . The Commission could provide considerable impetus here, but the Council in its wisdom has decided to keep the standing committee on Schengen implementation. This might have been justified if Schengen was to be extended, but it is unacceptable that this committee should be entrusted with monitoring the implementation of Schengen. I would therefore like to ask the Council for clearer information on this. It seems to be something of a curate\"s egg. All in all, I hope that this agreement will mean that both Parliament and the next Commission will be more closely involved in the policy areas that previously came under Schengen.', 'Cederschiöld (PPE). – (SV) Mr President, let me begin by expressing my delight over the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty. The Treaty of Amsterdam secures free movement of persons throughout Europe, but we naturally want to avoid creating a free‐for‐all for those intent on crime. Priority must be given to protecting the public. With Schengen as part of the Treaty, more effective safeguards will be offered. Finding the appropriate technical solutions has nevertheless proved a very tough task. We in the European Parliament are understandably dissatisfied with the lack of parliamentary involvement in some areas.', 'The Nordic countries have enjoyed free movement for a long time, and it has facilitated our relations with one another. Schengen will perform a similar service for the EU as a whole. It is therefore fortunate that the Nordic passport union will be protected. The Nordic group of countries is very vigilant when it comes to common Nordic legislation, the existence of which has meant so much to us.', 'If Nordic and EU legislation were to clash in any particular area – and there are differing views as to the likelihood of this – then we would naturally need to ensure coordination. Iceland and Norway have been granted much greater authority in respect of border controls; they now share in the overall responsibility for monitoring the Union\"s external frontiers. Effective operation of the system is essential, which means ensuring that Norway and Iceland perform to the same standards as the EU countries on border controls and combating crime.', 'The presidency has maintained a good dialogue with this committee on Schengen issues, keeping us informed of events. I nonetheless wish to draw attention to the provisions in the Treaty which state that Parliament must not be sidelined in the consultation process. As representatives of the people of Europe, we deserve to be much more involved than we have been to date in these matters. The role of the European Parliament has been too weak. And we have been given far too little time for deliberation. Translations of texts were sometimes missing, meaning that people could barely follow the proceedings in committee. This is no way to approach such issues. I therefore hope that the Council will today endorse the view that, in future, sufficient time must be set aside for proper consideration of these matters. We are dealing with sensitive questions and need to ensure that a real exchange takes place between Parliament and the Council.', 'Wiebenga (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, this is the last debate we shall be having on European justice policy in this parliamentary term. When we started in July 1994, the Maastricht Treaty had just entered into force. We in the Liberal Group hoped that the Council of Ministers would be vigorous in tackling its responsibilities here, because combating large‐scale international crime and fleshing out Europe\"s asylum and immigration policy are matters of considerable importance. When we now look back over this parliamentary term, we are forced to conclude – I am sorry to say – that the Council has made little progress. What has been achieved in these five years? There are 500 000 displaced people in Kosovo, but does Europe have an asylum policy? No. The Commission recently came to grief over allegations of fraud. Are the five fraud agreements in force yet? Again, no.', 'None of this is the European Parliament\"s fault. Here again we have often not been kept informed. When we were, we carried out our legislative duties as quickly as possible, only to find that the Council took not the slightest notice of what we said. I would say to the ministers and also to the officials – although I know that this is unusual – that they really need to change their attitude and their approach. Take Parliament seriously and stop rejecting everything so high‐handedly.', 'If we are honest, the Commission could also have played a more active role in this field. Some good progress has been made, but more could have been done. Schengen has now finally become firmly rooted in the European Union, which we have to admit is a positive development, even though Parliament was not adequately consulted. We will now want to take a closer look for ourselves at the decisions which have been taken.', 'Finally, I regret to say that I cannot thank the Council on behalf of the Liberal Group for the work it has done during this period, because as I just said the results are far from satisfactory. However, I would like to thank Commissioner Gradin, who is unfortunately not here, and her officials, and I would like above all to call on the Council and the new Commission to make sure that the Tampere summit is a success.', 'Pradier (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, the Group of the European Radical Alliance is very particular about issues of freedom. Schengen therefore remains one of our major concerns, both with regard to the freedom of movement of EU nationals and also with regard to freedom being indivisible for third country nationals who reside legally in one of the countries of the Union.', 'In this respect, I think that we could perhaps ask the Ministers in the Council to insist that France ceases to abuse derogating clauses, particularly with regard to border controls between Belgium and France. To come back to my main point, I think that the Schengen Executive Committee has therefore been replaced by the Council. The Council presidency, proud of its newfound glory, has defined, regulated and established legal bases. It has established terms of association in splendid isolation, without consulting, and sometimes without even informing, the people\"s representatives, at least with regard to definitive texts.', 'Parliament is clearly not satisfied with this attitude. We are once again in the position of having to request, no, demand, that the Treaty be respected. It is high time that the new presidency conformed to this fresh request. It is high time that we had a clear definition of police and judicial cooperation, and that we knew precisely who does what and in what context.', 'The new Commission will have a lot of work to do in order to present a coherent plan at Tampere, and so that Schengen can bring about the area of freedom, security and justice that everyone desires.', 'Krarup (I‐EDN). – (DA) I have only one or two comments to make. It is a well‐known fact that the People\\'s Movement against the EU, which I represent, is opposed to the Schengen system, as I am myself, mainly for reasons of public security. I have no faith in claims that the construction of a supranational system of supervisory powers will benefit democracy in Europe. I presume that we all more or less wholeheartedly share the objective of establishing a humane refugee policy, but I take the view that democracy is best placed, as the Danes say, ‘in the pockets of the citizens\". Schengen has been included in the Amsterdam Treaty and the opportunity has been taken to sneak Norway and Iceland into the system, whose people have voted against the European Union. By virtue of association agreements, they have something which in reality is equivalent to two thirds membership of the European Union without any influence. This is an absurdity. But now that the Schengen system has been created, I would far rather that it were kept under the third pillar, and for once I find myself in the situation of being able to praise the presidency for the exceptional lack of efficiency that is inherent in the administration of these rules. I would like to add that this Parliament is naturally interested in ensuring the maximum possible openness with regard to these decisions, a wish I fully support. The conduct of the Council in this respect leaves a great deal to be desired, whether the Treaty is interpreted one way or the other.', 'Andersson (PPE). – (SV) Mr President, may I begin by saying ‘well done\" to the presidency. Schengen has now been successfully incorporated into the Treaty and we have a sensible balance between the first and third pillars. So the presidency certainly deserves our congratulations as far as the substance is concerned. Few people believed matters would be taken forward so fast.', 'However, there is ample room for criticism with regard to the provision of information to the European Parliament and the inadequate use made of the expertise of this directly elected assembly. Clearly – as a previous speaker said – we need to distinguish between the formal and the political levels. Possibly the Council did in fact follow the existing consultation procedures. Probably this was the case, although we still need to cross‐check. On such important political items as the incorporation of the Schengen acquis and the signing of an association agreement with two very special countries, I still believe that Council should have consulted Parliament and taken on board its views. That is where I feel the ministers slipped up. They came along to the committee and we talked. But Parliament could have been consulted; the Council would then have been able to receive our opinions in the form of reports. That is where the Council has missed out.', 'I do not wish to dwell further on issues connected with the first and third pillars; instead, let me concentrate on the association arrangements with Iceland and Norway. I was surprised to hear what the previous speaker had to say. I happen to know that he lives in Helsingør; I come from Helsingborg, four kilometres away. We both grew up on free movement. The benefits of such freedom, together with the existence of the Nordic passport union, have certainly had a marked influence on my life. I am delighted that we are now set to enjoy similar free movement with other countries too. The system has worked well for the Nordic area, and I am confident that it will work well for the European Union. And I am pleased that Norway and Iceland can also be associated in the agreement. It is somewhat rich that people should be criticising these two countries, when they are the ones behaving democratically and allowing their parliaments to decide. As far as I am aware, there will be a large parliamentary majority in favour – but no one\"s hand is being forced. It is up to the democratic institutions to take the decision on whether to participate in this cooperation process. Once the procedures have been completed, I am sure that Norway and Iceland will make the necessary legislative adjustments to bring themselves in line with the system. There should be no major problem here, nor with the Joint Supervisory Authority. The countries concerned will be able to make their voice heard, even though they will not have any formal decision‐taking rights.', 'Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, since I came to this House in 1994, Parliament has been very clear about the fact that the future of the European Union is at stake here, in this area bordering the third pillar, in this area of rights and freedoms. Since I came to Parliament, we have worked hard to broaden the extremely narrow limits of Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty. And we must acknowledge that, without doubt, these limits have been transcended, not only by including many of the issues that used to be under the third pillar in the EC Treaty, in other words, in the first pillar, but also by way of the relative progress made with Article 39.', 'I must say that Parliament has played an important role in these advances. I believe that we must highlight the good and bad aspects of this issue. And I believe that we must be consistent and faithful and exploit this principle of faithful cooperation between the institutions. As a result, we must acknowledge what the Council has done and particularly the German Presidency. I naturally appreciate the work involved in drawing up a list of the Schengen acquis, as we all know that the Schengen acquis was a web of rules and a web of international public law, which complicated matters even further.', 'Also, the presentation of this document on the legal bases of the Schengen acquis , which I have still not had time to study in detail, is clearly important.', 'And together with the progress made, we must acknowledge and be aware of the difficulties inherent in integrating the Schengen Agreement into the framework of the European Union. It represents a closed world that is also being built beyond the limits of the European Union so that it can function. And we must also bear in mind that this is how it was born.', 'Having said all this, Mr President, Parliament cannot remain motionless, for the reasons that have already been outlined. We have a duty to our people and it is extremely important where rights and freedoms are at stake. When the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union, we must clearly give our opinion. It is true that, legally speaking, we have no rights, and on some occasions, not within this House but in committee, some speakers have suggested that this be taken to the Court of Justice. We have no formal rights; we are not protected by the Treaty. Yet, politically speaking, there is no doubt that we must be here, we must be informed and we should have been consulted on these decisions. That was not the case. It is not enough for the German Presidency to merely tell us what they have tried to do, and this must be very clear.', 'To conclude, I should like to mention two aspects that the German Presidency has agreed will come under the first pillar: the protection of personal data and the issuing of visas. You are all undoubtedly aware that we must be especially vigilant on these issues. We also hope that the initiatives being taken, particularly by the Commission, will outline some clear future guidelines that will allow us to make progress at the next summit in Tampere.', 'd\"Ancona (PSE), chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. – (NL) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs I am naturally pleased, along with all the other Members who have spoken, that there has been a successful outcome and that the presidency has been able to tell us that the Schengen agreement has now been integrated into the Treaty on European Union. However, we are still in the dark about the details. It seems that considerable sections of the Schengen acquis have been transferred to the first pillar, but the exact extent is difficult to determine at the moment.', 'The Council is to blame for this lack of information, which is making it difficult for us to make any sort of assessment. The President‐in‐Office said that the Council had put in a lot of appearances here. This is true, we did see you quite often, but that is not the same thing as providing us with information or involving us in the decision making. None of that happened; despite what the presidency promised in March 1998, Parliament was not even kept informed.', 'Parliament nevertheless has to do its duty and produce a legal and political assessment of the decisions the Council has now taken. I would like to ask you a few questions. What is the legal status of the section that has been transferred to the first pillar? Does it take the form of directives or regulations? We need to be clear about this if we are to avoid problems with any cases that may come before the Court.', 'It unfortunately seems that none of the problems with the Schengen information system have been resolved. It has been put under the third pillar temporarily, but how long is ‘temporary\"? The lack of clarity on this point is extremely regrettable, because if we agree to it we will be landed with an entirely unwelcome responsibility. Who is to monitor the operation of the system? Who is to supervise it? The Commission or the Schengen Executive Committee?', 'My final point is something Mr Wiebenga also mentioned. A great deal of decisiveness is still needed and there is still a large amount of work to be done. Commissioner Monti is to come up with a new proposal on visas as soon as possible after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force. We are keenly awaiting an active asylum policy and the development of a series of instruments for determining violations of basic rights. The application of Article 286 of the Treaty is a good indicator here. Personal data are to be protected, along with the people to whom the data refer, naturally, and the European institutions are also going to have to comply with this.', 'In short, we are happy with this outcome, which is better than nothing. But there is still an incredible amount to be done, hopefully in cooperation with Parliament once it has been properly informed.', \"Schapper, Council. – (DE) Mr President, on the involvement of Parliament and the transmission of documents, let me say again that the political agreement was reached on 26 April, and I hope you will appreciate that the documents could not be sent before then. As you know, we had to work right up to the last minute before managing to secure that agreement. We shall naturally continue our endeavours to reach an agreement on the place of the Schengen information system in the EU framework, but I am not very sure that this aim will be achieved before the end of the German Presidency. However, I should like to point out that, because of the automatic nature of the procedures laid down in the Schengen Protocol, the legal basis of the Schengen information system lies entirely within the third pillar. But this naturally means that the joint controlling body which has been monitoring compliance with the Schengen Agreement will continue to operate and will continue to ensure that data are being properly protected within the Schengen information system. As for certain provisions being assignable to the first pillar, Mrs d'Ancona, these are, of course, covered by individual provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty and have thus become integral parts of the Treaty. This, to my mind, is one quite palpable result that has actually been achieved.\", 'I should like to reiterate in general terms that, for all the importance of the results that have now been achieved, the real political decision consisted in the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam. What has now taken place is the implementation of that decision. It is pleasing that this has been achieved with a fair degree of success.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Schapper.', 'I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5).(1)', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place at 11 a.m.']}, {'topic': '3. Legal aspects of electronic trading', 'paragraphs': [\"President . – The next item is the report (A4‐0248/99) by Mrs Oddy, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on certain legal aspects of electronic commerce in the internal market (COM(98)0586 – C4‐0020/99‐98/0325(COD)).\", 'Draftsmen (Hughes procedure):\\nMr Hoppenstedt, Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy\\nMr Whitehead, Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection', \"Oddy (PSE), rapporteur. ‐ Mr President, I would firstly like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for the sterling effort they have made. I have put the staff and my colleagues under tremendous pressure to get this through in the May part‐session. I would particularly like to thank the staff members who have had to work exceptionally hard. I would also like to say that my colleagues have been remarkably good‐natured and entered into the discussion in a spirit of cooperation and good will. Because of that we have managed to complete the work on time.\", 'This is a very important area. Electronic commerce is a growth area. It should produce a lot more prosperity for the European Union. It is helpful to consumers and companies alike. Consumers benefit by being able to shop on the Internet in the comfort of their own home and enjoy home deliveries. It is quicker, simpler and consumers can do research on the market for the goods they want, much more simply.', 'Companies benefit also by having contracts of major importance. It opens up the market across borders and gives consumers much more choice because it is easier to get goods – if you are British for instance – from France, Germany or Greece.', 'But there are some snags. We need to ensure that the law we establish is clear, simple and that problems can be rectified easily. We need to ensure that consumers can be confident that they are not dealing with rogue companies and that when they enter their credit card number into the computer they will actually receive the goods and not find that the company has disappeared. In the vote in committee we put great emphasis on codes for regulating industry and for greater consumer cooperation. I feel this is important.', 'Looking at the detail of the proposal, when you are trying to harmonise what is effectively contract law over 15 countries, that is difficult. The Commission was keen to ensure that it was clear when a contract was completed with a third click. The Legal Affairs Committee is concerned about that because is seems unduly onerous and it is more likely that mistakes might occur.', \"On the issue of conflict of law, which is a horrendously difficult legal subject, we need to ensure that the rules are clear. I like the Commission's idea of having the certainty of home country law applying. This gives the advantage of simplicity and clarity. But again, we have to be aware that consumers need protection.\", \"A lot of the debate has turned on the subject of copyright and illegal material. We have to get a balance here between civil liberties, freedom of expression, people's freedom to put on the Internet what they want, no more official snooping on the Internet than there would be on the post or telephone, and balance the other argument that companies should not have people infringing copyright, infringing their logo, and pretending to be a company that they are not. It is a really big problem for well‐known companies that other companies steal their designs and ideas.\", 'I feel we have just about achieved the right balance in the Legal Affairs Committee. Again, that is because of the good‐natured discussion of my colleagues trying to reach a satisfactory, simple solution.', 'The last point I want to flag‐up is ‘spamming\", unsolicited e‐mail. I do not believe that those consumers who want to ban all unsolicited e‐mails are correct. I personally, as a consumer, like getting some on my interest areas like details of what is on at the theatre. I do not want it banned totally. I want the opt‐out.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR COT\\nVice‐President', \"Whitehead (PSE), draftsman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. ‐ Mr President, I should like to pay a very warm tribute to my colleague, Ms Oddy, for this report which characteristically she has taken through in the last days of the Parliament in a committee where there were other preoccupations and where there were immense legal and technical complications. It is not an easy subject and some of us feel that to bring this forward in the last few months of the Parliament when it needed considerable reflection and study was a little premature. Nevertheless, we have offered an opinion and I believe that Parliament's committees jointly have attempted to make sense of this difficult matter.\", 'I agree with Ms Oddy on two of the key areas she raised today. Firstly, the issue of country of origin. This makes common sense. I know some of the consumer movements disagree with me but the only rational way to trace out responsibility is to do it along this line.', 'The second area where I agree with her is that in the issue of opting in or opting out we have to give the consumer the right to opt out, but to prescribe what may, or may not, be put on the Net is so to restrict the expansion of this traffic that we would have a harmful effect within the single market itself.', 'We also have to be very careful that we strike a correct balance between liberty, on the one hand, and licence, on the other, between the world of private rights and the world of public obligations.', 'The only area where I, and the Committee on the Environment, whose opinion I presented, differ from our friends and colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs, is on the issue of whether we have gone the right way in terms of consumer protection. In my opinion in some areas we have not. I do not believe that the amendment that seeks to bring broadcasting regulations into what is, essentially, a one‐to‐one transaction between individuals is right. We should vote down that amendment.', 'We have also gone far too far to bring in some of the issues of copyright into this debate, where they have no place whatsoever. In my opinion, it would be far better to go straight down the line with the proposals that originally came from the Commission in this area.', \"Hoppenstedt (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, electronic trade, e‐commerce, is sweeping the world. The United States, Europe, Japan and even China are examining the realities of electronic commerce as well as focusing some of their attention on what, at the present time, remain mere visions. These visions are expected to become reality in two to three years' time, which, if the figures can be believed, would mean that by the year 2001 some 110 million PCS will be used for electronic commerce, generating a trading volume of 200 billion dollars – an enormous sum. It is easy enough to say that, but numerous questions remain unanswered. A great many of these are answered in the Commission proposal and in the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and I believe that both of those bodies have done an excellent job. Allow me, however, to add in all modesty that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy also recognises its own opinion, delivered under the Hughes procedure, in parts of this report.\", \"The Group of the European People's Party and large sections of the Legal Affairs Committee therefore support the Commission draft. But we have had to agonise over some of the amendments, including those on the liability of intermediary providers. Three or four amendments from Mr Barzanti and one from Mr Glante fall into this category. I believe that these amendments undermine the structure and the logic of this entire report. For that reason, our group will be voting against them.\", 'One very important and very dangerous element is Amendment No 63, in which Mr Glante proposes reopening the question of exempting activities definable as broadcasting. In Article 1 of the television directive, we said very clearly what new services mean and how new services are to be defined. We also made a clear statement by saying that we want these new services to develop and that we shall discuss frameworks for the revision of the television directive again in the year 2002. It goes without saying that we in Parliament naturally expect the Commission to honour its pledge to hold a large‐scale discussion of the implications for audiovisual services. That was one of the pledges which were made. When they will be honoured is not known. But I believe this ought to be mentioned here, since it was one of the balancing acts that were performed to secure our support for Article 1.', 'The majority of our group will vote against this amendment, because they believe, as I do, that it is out of place here. The fact that the German federal states are pressurising the German Government to have services comparable to broadcasting, as they are called here, exempted from the rules governing electronic commerce derives from the internal situation in Germany. I believe that the public broadcasting system, which is certainly a staunch advocate of this amendment, really ought to trust the Commission and ourselves to continue the discussion of this matter. I have a request, which I have made in our amendment, that Annex 2 should be put to the vote in the form adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, because it is my view that the common market, the internal market, can develop better with this Annex 2 as we formulated it in the Economic Affairs Committee. That, of course, is consumer protection too. We can help by ensuring that benefits for consumers develop from the great struggle between conventional trade and the electronic networks. The shopping experience must be reshaped, and I believe we are progressing in that direction.', \"Heinisch (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is essentially a good means of creating a minimalist regulatory regime in the field of electronic commerce. Ms Oddy's report also sets out a clear line of approach which accords with the spirit of the Commission draft. May I also express my sincere thanks to her for adopting the proposals made by the Committee on Culture.\", 'I should like to refer to one or two of these proposals. It is essential to guarantee freedom of expression in the new information services. The more open the networks, the greater will be the cultural diversity we can enjoy. At the same time, in the areas in which Community action is appropriate, the directive has to provide strong safeguards, especially as regards the protection of young people and of human dignity. The people of the Union will use the facility of electronic commerce to the extent that it proves useful in satisfying their everyday requirements in the real world. However, the Internet must be accessible to everyone. By ensuring that children learn how to use these new forms of technology at an early age and that training opportunities are provided for adults, we must prevent the exclusion of European citizens from the benefits of information technology.', 'The connection between electronic commerce and medicines is a point I wish to address as a pharmacist and as a member of the Committee on Culture. For more than 30 years, medicines have been subject to a complex system of rules, which serves primarily to protect patients and consumers. Strict controls on the marketing, advertising and sale of medicinal products are in place at both the national and European levels. The Internet could invalidate some of these rules. There are misgivings about safety, the conduct of transactions, payment, the treatment of confidential information, the possible misuse of personal data, the quality of the products and the absence of expert advice. In order to protect patients, who are the consumers in this case – and I am thinking especially of our young people here – we must guarantee the application of Council Directive 92/28/EEC on the advertising of medicinal products for human use to electronic commerce in medicinal products.', 'Barzanti (PSE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, this long‐awaited directive enriches the European Union\"s impressive body of legal texts establishing rules for many aspects of the information society. This text certainly deals with one of the most sensitive matters; as clarified, completed and corrected by the Legal Committee, the directive definitely appears useful and acceptable.', 'The point is not to overburden service providers with undue and unusual costs and unreasonable monitoring responsibilities. The limitations on liability provided for make up a simplified legal framework, while still recognising the serious problems which arise. I should stress that the list of liability limitations should be exhaustive, because this is the only way in which the directive really will lead to harmonisation.', 'If, ladies and gentlemen, we wish to combat the rise in illegal activities, those offering on‐line services need to be able to provide all the information required to trace and identify illegal content providers, whilst of course still complying with the provisions of Community law on the protection of personal data. We need to give those entitled the means to carry out surveillance, we need strategies to combat unlawful conduct, and we need to use notification and deletion procedures by means of appropriate electronic instruments.', 'The directive does not aim – nor would it be able – to call into question what has already been achieved by the legislation on copyright and related rights, which was voted on a short time ago, nor – and might I point this out to Mr Hoppenstedt – is it intended either to apply to what is already covered and harmonised by the Television Without Frontiers Directive or to revise the definitions consolidated in the latter.', 'The scope of this directive is separate and distinct; I do not think that anyone wishes to cause untimely confusion here. There is a fundamental distinction to be made between technologies, technical management of networks and the protection and promotion of contents and works. This is the major conclusion to be drawn from the long and intensive debate on the convergence of technologies and means of disseminating messages which has been on‐going for some time. As I have said on previous occasions and will repeat once again, cyberspace is not a no man\"s land.', 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this my last speech as a Member of the European Parliament I mentioned the Television Without Frontiers Directive. This was the subject of my first ever report, back in 1988. If I were to seek a leitmotiv running through my modest yet steadfast and devoted work over the fifteen years I have been here, I think I would find it in my determination to help provide Europe, our beloved Europe, with effective instruments to guarantee pluralism of information, protection of creativity, support for the dissemination of European works and new momentum in audiovisual production, making the most out of irrevocable differences between cultures and transforming an apparent weakness into a strength.', 'I would like to thank all those whose cooperation has allowed me to enjoy such a productive and unforgettable experience, and I do hope that these subjects will be given the time and attention they deserve and benefit from our Parliament\"s universally acknowledged determination and consistency.', 'Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, I am taking the floor for the last time on behalf of the Group of the European People\"s Party to reply to Mr Barzanti, who has just spoken on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I feel that I can but sum up, in one single sentence, what I believe many of us are feeling: we will miss you a great deal. I believe this institution as a whole will miss you a great deal as, of course, will all of us who have had the honour of working with you. We will miss you here although we hope that we will be able to continue to rely on your knowledge and your advice.', 'Mr President, to move on to the substance of this directive, I believe that some of the more important problems it raises have already been discussed. This is a proposal for a directive that seeks to establish a difficult balance, a balance between service providers and those who provide the content, a balance between consumers and suppliers. In short, it seeks a balance between interests competing in the market, and all these interested parties deserve protection.', 'Taking this as a starting point, I believe we must acknowledge the major task achieved by the European Commission. This involved knowing where to stop, as this directive is special in that it does not attempt to regulate everything, but what it does regulate, it regulates sensibly and with an underlying idea, one that guides and directs it. I believe that Parliament would be making a mistake if it were to alter these balances. It would be making a mistake to attempt to modify such a delicate situation where, in my humble opinion, has been dealt with very well.', 'As my colleague Mr Hoppenstedt has spoken on particular amendments in detail and because the PPE Group is well coordinated, all I can say as spokesperson for the group is that I agree with everything he said. I would just like to add a few clarifications, particularly on the subject of liability.', 'The Group of the European People\"s Party will vote against some of the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights on the issue of liability, particularly Amendments Nos 45, 46, 47, 48 and 50 to 54. We will vote against them as we feel they upset this balance. Despite what Mr Barzanti said, which is a philosophy we fully agree with, I believe that they are of no benefit to content providers or authors in general terms. And in response to Mr Whitehead, there is little protection for consumers if we act in an arbitrary fashion when legislating. Therefore, and more specifically, it is meaningless to impose limits on service providers\" liability for specific policies or specific activities. It is also nonsense to expect that they will, for example, be notified of this by the relevant authorities.', 'To sum up, Mr President, the Group of the European People\"s Party supports the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs to a very large degree. It also supports some of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group and, on the whole, except for the amendments mentioned by Mr Hoppenstedt and myself, we will vote in favour of these amendments in general.', 'Thors (ELDR). – (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Ms Oddy said, this report, which is the last of many on the information society, is the most important one of all. Contrary to what happened with the directive on copyright in the information society, we have managed – in just a short period of time – to conduct a more informative debate. Passion and zeal, rather than the search for new knowledge, tended to dominate those copyright discussions.', 'I should like to thank Ms Oddy for her work. The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights will miss her open‐minded approach. She is very much her own person, and a creative one at that – even if we occasionally disagreed over my use of her mother tongue, English!', 'I do, however, endorse what has been said by those speakers who found the Commission\"s proposal more balanced. I certainly feel that to be the case with regard to the duty of surveillance, the question of technology, and neutrality in terms of different standards. My group will therefore be voting against many of the amendments on these points. However, I would like to ask for support from the other groups on the matter of a technology‐neutral solution for signing up to agreements and contracts. The Committee on Legal Affairs has improved the proposal considerably here, but there is still one noticeable shortcoming from my point of view. We are currently too obsessed with ‘clicking\" on buttons. There have to be other ways of concluding electronic commerce agreements.', 'I now have an afterthought, a little late in the day. I suspect that, when we use the words \"electronic commerce\", many people do not know what we mean. A better term must be found, since more than straight ‘commerce\" is at stake here. We are talking about issues of liability and the ground rules which will apply to the whole information society.', 'Sadly, I have to note that even one\"s fellows forsake one from time to time. The proposal put forward in the Legal Affairs Committee on ‘spamming\" came from me, yet my group will be voting for an alternative proposal. The discussion so far nevertheless suggests that my idea stands a good chance of getting through. I honestly think that we would be making life far too easy for certain telecoms companies if we decided to adopt the amendment which has been tabled. I am sorry that it has come to this.', \"Sandbæk (I‐EDN). – (DA) Mr President, International Consumers' Day was celebrated in March, with the theme of electronic commerce and consumer protection. Commerce on the Internet does not in itself raise new problems of consumer policy, but since we are talking about a new medium, there is a need to establish security and confidence. Commerce using digital networks should be at least as secure and safe as commerce in the physical world. It is therefore unacceptable that the Commission's proposal should seek to put Danish consumers in a worse position in relation to commerce using digital networks than is the case for commerce in the physical world. One of the major problems with the directive is that it is the rules of the country of origin that apply. This will mean that countries with a high level of protection may risk being overrun with advertisements and marketing from firms and from countries which have a lower level of protection. The level of protection in the Nordic countries is generally higher than in other countries, especially as far as marketing in relation to children is concerned. This could result in distortion of competition, whereby foreign firms are able to use methods which Danish firms are not permitted to use under the Danish Marketing Practices Act.\", \"The background to the principle of using the rules of the country of origin is that it is too difficult for trade and industry to be familiar with every Member State's legislation in this area. But the consequence is that this burden is simply placed on the shoulders of the consumers. For the consumer, commerce on the Internet thus virtually takes on the character of Russian roulette. What rules apply, and what rights do we have if something goes wrong?\", 'I support the amendments, which improve the directive, but I cannot support the text as a whole – and the June Movement cannot support the text as a whole – because it still takes the country of origin principle as its starting‐point.', 'Hager (NI). – (DE) Mr President, the need to ensure that European business remains competitive is one reason why the creation of a uniform legal framework for electronic commerce is indispensable. In this particular field, common rules are one of the main prerequisites for efficient commercial transactions. At the same time, due consideration must be given to the safety aspect and to protection from illegal activities and health hazards.', 'Regular commercial abuse of the Internet is one of the unfortunate realities of cyberspace that cannot be ignored. Effective control mechanisms are therefore essential. On the one hand, the development of software for the recognition of illegal content must be supported with a view to ensuring that these controls are more than a token gesture. We must therefore forge ahead with the promotion of the necessary research projects. On the other hand, however, I believe we should also consider whether the only type of control that is likely to be effective, namely control by the provider, cannot be effected in future in a technically and economically expedient way. Public access to the information made available by providers would be appropriate in the light of the special responsibility borne by providers of online services.', 'Let me conclude by dealing with a very specific problem. Among the possibilities opened up by the draft directive is the purchase of medicinal products without expert advice, which, as Mrs Heinisch said, creates a potential health risk that must not be underestimated. Moreover, the Internet offers opportunities for large‐scale fraud at the expense of patients, as the WHO, along with other bodies, has repeatedly stressed. These things have to be borne in mind. Although the draft directive, when all is said and done, is a step in the direction of an Internet that would serve the best interests of society, there is still a long way to go before that aim can be achieved.', 'Medina Ortega (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, it is fortunate that we have you as President of the sitting in this House at the moment because this is one of the last reports, if not the very last, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights and you were a very efficient member of that committee for many years. At the moment, today\\'s sitting has a rather nostalgic feel to it because we are reaching the end of this parliamentary term and some of our colleagues will not return. Others may perhaps return but, in short, the current Parliament is dissolving and at the moment there is a certain amount of nostalgia, a hint of twilight to this sitting.', 'I should like to take this opportunity to point out that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights has always been known for the great deal of internal work it does and for the high level of coordination within the committee. Above all, I should like to point out that our rapporteur, Mrs Christine Oddy, with her usual skill, has helped, and will always help, make our work easier within the committee.', 'At the moment we are debating a directive on certain legal aspects of electronic commerce in the internal market. This directive attempts to harmonise certain aspects of the Member States\" legislation, aspects which, in truth, are aspects of private law. I would say that we are dealing with an area where Member States seem rather small. This area covers the whole electronic commerce sector, the electronic activities sector covering everything from intellectual property to digital signatures and everything related to information services in general, including intellectual property issues. And not only do the Member States and the European Union seem small but also the world in general as, at a speed of three hundred thousand kilometres per second, borders have no real significance.', 'If the European Union did not exist, we would have had to have invented it simply for this. With the fifteen or twenty or so Member States that will eventually make up the European Union, we cannot maintain different legal systems; rather, we must establish a full, specific and correct code. And, of course, I believe that, by definition, the principle of subsidiarity cannot be invoked at all in this field.', 'When it comes to electronic issues, it is true that the beginnings of legislation are beginning to take shape precisely because of the major violation of privacy bringing computers into our homes may entail. On the screen, our children, our friends and our families may be exposed to a flood of information, which may well be unsolicited. I feel that we are currently exaggerating the cultural elements that set us apart within the European Union. In the European Union today, for better or for worse and despite national cultural traditions, the basic principles, the principles of law and order and the principles of the protection of morals, rights and minors still apply. I therefore believe that, at the moment, a directive such as this will make it easier to integrate our national legislations through the defence of certain principles that are common to all the Member States.', 'Therefore, as a member of the Socialist Group, I should like to express my support for the proposal for a directive as proposed by Mrs Oddy.', 'Cassidy (PPE). – Mr President, in common with many other people, this is positively my last performance in this House. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur who I know has worked very hard on this proposal. It is a very detailed dossier, a heavily lobbied dossier, as I know to my cost. As always, when you have a heavily lobbied dossier one of the problems is that the lobbies cancel each other out, which demonstrates how Members of the European Parliament have to be able to cope with lobbyists, like they have to be able to cope with journalists.', 'We must not forget, however, that this is a proposal from the Commission. I would like to congratulate the Commission on having produced a very practical text. Indeed so practical was it that I withdrew all of my amendments to some of the controversial Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 and made a suggestion – which I was surprised they rejected – that colleagues like Mr Barzanti and others should withdraw their amendments as well. But as they did not the EPP will be voting against a number of amendments which were passed in committee.', 'One in particular which I feel very strongly about is Amendment No 45, which was originally put in committee by Mr Barzanti, which would allow means of surveillance to be rendered operational on the basis of legislation or codes of conduct. I am very unhappy about that.', 'Mr Barzanti told us that in his ten years here he has concentrated on European culture and protecting it. Fine. In 15 years here I have been dedicated to Europe being open to world trade and particularly to liberalisation. The Commission has put forward a liberalising proposal. It would be very unfortunate if the European Parliament were to appear to be less liberal than the Commission, bearing in mind that we are talking of a very high technology, fast‐moving area where Europe is in very grave danger of falling further and further behind the United States.', 'Watson (ELDR). – Mr President, I would like to talk about junk mail or ‘spamming\". Junk mail through the post is an inconvenience but junk mail received electronically or by fax is actually charged to the telephone bill of the recipient. That is why it must be legislated for separately. I have received 42 pieces of junk e‐mail in the last week alone and I can tell you it is a bloody nuisance. I have not personally received anything offensive but I know a number of my constituents have and 10\\u2009% of unsolicited e‐mail is now pornographic.', 'There are programmes available through which companies can harvest names from the Web and send out vast amounts of e‐mail to companies. A report last year from Novell showed that junk e‐mail has cost British and Irish businesses £5b a year. It also jams up the networks. We have legal cases pursued by Virgin Net in the UK and Bibliotech in the US, taking the fight against spammers to the courts.', \"Last month 23 000 signatures on a petition were presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights of this House. They call for junk e‐mail to be banned. The opt‐out does not work. There is one in the United States. It has proved to be unworkable. I disagree with Ms Oddy. I believe it ill behoves us as legislators to legitimise a practice which allows advertisers to invite themselves to use other people's telephone bills and to use Internet provider infrastructure to pay for their marketing.\", 'There is every reason why an opt‐in would work. It gives the consumers the opportunity to request marketing information that they want; it gives advertisers the possibility to target their messages to those who wish to receive them; it gives the Internet providers, who provide access to the Net, the possibility to continue to provide fast, effective and safe electronic e‐mail.', 'That is why my group is calling for support for Amendment No 70 to this report.', 'Blokland (I‐EDN). – (NL) Mr President, now that we can expect electronic trading to become increasingly important, a solid legal framework is needed which offers consumers adequate protection. This is the only way to make people confident enough to get involved in this form of commerce. At the same time, consumers must be able to protect themselves effectively against unsolicited e‐mail. I also feel it is extremely important to protect those who are under age and to protect human dignity.', 'It is also important to combat illegal activities on the Internet. I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether the way in which the Committee on Legal Affairs has formulated this in Amendment No 48 is acceptable. Will this not be making Internet service providers into censors? I have nothing against censorship, but it should be carried out by the police and the courts.', 'Finally, I have to say that reading the amendments filled me with enormous respect for the Committee on Legal Affairs. Take for example Amendment No 23 on recital 22, which has an 88‐word sentence that left me completely baffled.', 'Paasilinna (PSE). – (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important directive, and will play its part in building the information society. Christine Oddy\"s report is, in my opinion, a well‐informed, skilful and excellent one. It is also important for us to ensure that, in enacting legislation, we do not create bottlenecks for businesses in this fast‐growing sector.', 'I believe, however, that the big problem with the Internet is the protection and freedom of the individual. The scale of the problem has not yet revealed itself. This is a historical stage in the process, one in which the global surveillance of people has become possible, and it is the first time civil rights have not been protected by international borders, as they used to be. In this respect we have entered a new era, and it must therefore be possible to opt out or opt in. I have also received junk mail, even in a language I do not understand. For some reason, a lot of it comes in Spanish from one particular sender. We must be able to put a stop to this. I cannot see how the police can take action, although that is what should be the case.', 'I think the European Union needs to take action to create an effective, sound civil rights and protection movement in respect of the Internet. I would ask the Commissioner whether such a suggestion has been discussed. It would involve encouraging civil participation at European level, and protecting people\"s rights, in order to prevent this adverse trend from getting out of control. As a trading place it must be safe, because that is also in the interest of business. We must be able to locate criminal material, which should not have to be a job for the police. The post office, for example, looks out for a bomb, if one is suspected. The same should go for the Internet. When a third party sends information, that party can obviously be made liable for the bill, and liability should extend also to cases where a crime has been committed.', 'Lulling (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, my colleague Mr Hoppenstedt has already done a very good job of explaining my group\"s position on Mrs Oddy\"s report. I thank Mrs Oddy for her report, but in the very heated debate that has developed on the subject of electronic commerce in Europe and the thorny issue of on‐line content, its origin, its destination and its legality, I think I am justified in stressing that there must be room for freedom of expression on public networks such as the Internet.', 'I would like to concentrate on an aspect which particularly concerns satellite providers. With regard to the responsibility of the on‐line network service providers, the initial proposal from the European Commission distinguishes the responsibility of the various players according to what they actually do, without denying the problems of illegal content. In my opinion there is no point in amending this. In the transfer of information by satellite, cable or any other means, the network service providers, who are the intermediaries, are not the authors of the content. They may have to accept responsibility a posteriori for the information that they supply and they may also ensure that there is a priori monitoring at the request of national authorities, but in very specific cases.', 'However, they cannot ensure permanent a priori monitoring of all the information – freely available on the Internet – to which they want to offer access. The network service providers are suppliers of technical services and do not have editorial responsibility. In a way, they play the role of the printers, which does not mean that they can print whatever they like, but their responsibility is not unlimited. The Web is an excellent tool for any firm or individual that wishes to make itself known, a tool that should be developed and not censored. Like my group, I will not vote for Amendments Nos 45, 46, 48 and 51, which have absolutely nothing to do with the issue and which would result in an impractical degree of censorship.', 'Plooij‐van Gorsel (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, I too would like to address my remarks primarily to Commissioner Liikanen. Ladies and gentlemen, electronic commerce could be a tremendous boost to the economy and create a great many new jobs, jobs that Europe desperately needs. The proposed directive now before us will remove many obstacles and uncertainties and provide legal certainty and security for all those involved, particularly consumers. However, as well as the problem of ‘spamming\" which Graham Watson described, there is another problem too. Section 4, Articles 12 and 13 of the directive provide that where a service provider is only passing on information passively, it is not liable for the content of that information. So it is only operating as an intermediary.', 'The same applies to the temporary storage of information on the Internet, known as ‘caching\". Indeed, it appears from the explanatory statement to the Commission proposal that the restricted liability actually applies to all illegal on‐line activities by third parties, such as unfair competition, misleading advertising and the pirating of copyright material.', 'However, two months ago Parliament adopted an amendment to Article 5(1) of the copyright directive specifically bringing caching within the scope of the directive, so that it would be covered by copyright protection, yet caching as such does not involve any individual use of the information supplied. There is a contradiction here. I would like to ask the Commissioner something. These provisions contradict each other ...', '(The President cut the speaker off)', 'President . – I am sorry, Mrs Plooij‐van Gorsel, I have to cut you off because we are constrained by speaking time. I am very sorry.', 'Bru Purón (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, I too should like to sing a form of swan song. For many years – although at different stages – I have been part of this House and I am now saying goodbye to it, not as far as my heart is concerned, as it will always be remembered there, but as far as my usual attendance here is concerned. I remember many moments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights and, among them, those shared with Mrs Oddy where we always reached similar conclusions on new technology issues that we began debating in the previous term with respect to their incompatibility with copyright.', 'I should like to congratulate Mrs Oddy and also my colleagues who have tabled amendments, for example, Amendment No 45, that my dear colleague Mr Cassidy is criticising. Mr Cassidy, I believe in freedom for men and women. We must be careful with devastating mechanical technologies that have no consideration for human nature. There is no reason why the network should eliminate the need for a certain degree of control, which is needed both for our children and for ourselves.', 'Octavio Paz said that we are not made for a society whose aim is to produce to consume and to consume to produce. The fact that messages are sent to create artificial consumption is often distressing to a person, as pornography and other such things are. I believe that all this rubbish should be controlled. And I therefore feel that it is a good idea to have a certain degree of control at the centre of this network so that the consumer – which is first and foremost a human being – can tell where the problem comes from. If we control the network, we create a place for the law, and the law must, of course, be above mere technology.', 'Cederschiöld (PPE). – (SV) Mr President, forecasts suggest that, within just a few years, 500 million people will be on the Internet. A whole new market has opened up, as Mr Hoppenstedt has so eloquently argued. We have here a potential springboard for European growth, but we must avoid taking the kind of political decisions that might force Internet providers to locate outside the Union.', 'In Amendment No 36, it is suggested that ‘information society service providers must keep all information necessary for the purpose of tracing and identifying providers of illegal content.\" This is a crime prevention issue, however, and responsibility for criminal matters lies with the country concerned. That is the approach taken by our competitor, the United States, and the same principle should apply here. The State bears the cost of crime prevention and takes the necessary decisions where there is suspicion of serious criminal activity. Very strict regulations and technical provisions may need to be put in place.', 'If the proposal in Amendment No 36 were to be implemented, some Internet service providers would be forced to establish themselves outside the Union, which would not be the best way of utilising the growth potential of the new Internet economy. The net result would be a typical political fudge, based on a misguided attempt to reconcile various societal interests. Such an approach is born, in my view, of insufficient knowledge of the sector.', 'The nominee for the office of Commission President, Mr Prodi, spoke on Tuesday of the importance of leading‐edge technology for Europe\"s advancement. And he was right. It is essential that we build up, rather than undermine, the conditions for growth within the IT industry, particularly from the point of view of small and medium‐sized companies, which need to be shielded from storage costs. Respect for the integrity of companies is also paramount, especially when they are small.', 'Herman (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the development of electronic commerce will have a considerable impact on the whole of society. It promises to create added value, and therefore jobs. It is also a world‐wide, global phenomenon, and it is unthinkable that we should be left out, as if Europe could be run as an island in the middle of the ocean. I therefore do not think that we should impose rules and constraints on ourselves that would mean placing ourselves on the fringe of this extremely rich field of development.', 'However, I am well aware of the risks that it involves and they must be eliminated or contained. Having said that, I felt that in this respect the Commission\"s proposal was very well balanced. With all that I am hearing, seeing and observing, I am now wondering whether the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights have upset this necessary balance. As most of the speakers from my group have pointed out, I do not think that in order to protect consumers – a concern which is nevertheless quite legitimate – we should at the same time deprive them of all the advantages and all the benefits that this development can bring, both in employment terms and in economic terms.', 'This is why I feel it is very important that we take great care to maintain this balance. This is why, along with my colleagues, I will vote in favour of certain amendments which aim to improve the situation, while on the other hand I will vote against others which I feel have upset the balance.', 'Garosci (PPE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, those who have been speaking in this Chamber for five years now should no longer feel emotional, but the thought that today is almost the last day of this parliamentary term does move me a little, to say the least. And since, as a famous writer from my country said, ‘there is no certainty in the morrow\", I shall take this opportunity to say good‐bye and thank you to all the colleagues, officials and interpreters with whom I have shared these five years which have been so important for European integration. It has been an honour for me to work with many of you.', 'The issue being discussed now is one of the most important of all in economic and social terms, both because it particularly relates to young people and because it can lead to many jobs being created.', 'Yesterday Parliament voted on my report on the White Paper on commerce, which looks at length and in favourable terms at electronic commerce as well.', 'I would also like to thank the Commission, which kept its pledge to produce the Green Paper and the White Paper on commerce within the same term of office, making sure that this sector was tackled comprehensively by the institutions.', 'In the White Paper we managed to get the Commission to undertake measures to support enterprises and at the same time to protect end‐users.', 'The legal aspects analysed today are a vital foundation for regulating and harmonising electronic contracts and future use and developments, on condition that the Internet is accessible to all, accessible but regulated, so as to defend the groups at greatest risk, particularly children, to protect people from unlawful electronic acts and cable intrusion, but to encourage anything which can create jobs and help our culture to grow and flourish. There can be no Europe without culture, as the great President Delors reminded us.', 'Even though much remains to be done in the new Community market, we have shown that it is possible to protect the interests of entrepreneurs and traders, particularly in small and medium‐sized enterprises, and at the same time to defend the public in their role as consumers, who are the target and focus of the work of enterprises, both public and private. Let us continue along this road!', 'Klass (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we live in the information age, and new channels of communication are constantly opening up. If we use them properly, they will present us with a vast range of opportunities which have to be grasped and which will enhance the competitiveness of European business. But we do need a uniform legal framework here. Internet users are bombarded with a barrage of online information. The Member States cannot rely on their national legislation, since there are no national restrictions on electronic commerce.', 'For the sake of consumer protection, the Member States and the Commission must press for the development of codes of conduct. One very important point concerns unsolicited commercial communications. ‘Spam\" must be clearly recognisable as such to recipients, who must also have a means of refusing it, especially in view of the costs they might incur by opening or downloading such messages. Greater transparency must be achieved in this area. Clear labelling of incoming messages is essential so that users are free to decide whether to avail themselves of the services being offered.', \"Liikanen, Commission. ‐ Mr President, the Commission is glad to know that Ms Oddy's report, which is very thorough, shares the approach and the main lines of the Commission's proposal. It is particularly important as regards the unanimous backing of the internal market principles underlying the proposal.\", \"The majority of the amendments in Ms Oddy's report clarify and improve the original proposal and I am happy to indicate that the Commission will accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 6 – the latter in the English version only, 7, 12, 13, 16‐20, 22, 24, 32‐34, 37, 40, 41, 43, 55‐57, 62, 65‐67. Subject to redrafting the Commission is also in a position to accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 11, 15, 25, 29 and 35 and part of amendments 9, 14, 38, 51, 69 and 73.\", 'There are, however, a number of amendments the Commission is not in a position to accept for one of the following four reasons.', \"Firstly, because their objective and formulation is not sufficiently clear, which could lead to legal insecurity. This is the case of Amendments Nos 8, 24, 26, 30, 39, 58, 59, 60, 64 and 72. Amendment No 42 cannot be accepted as such. However, the Commission recognises that Article 11(1) concerning the moment at which on‐line contracts are concluded needs to be reviewed. The Commission accepts the objective of Parliament's amendment to simplify the process of contracting and will address the question in the amended proposal.\", 'Secondly, because there would not be consistency with other Community directives or with Community law. This is the case of amendments which could be interpreted as being in conflict with the rules on the protection of personal data or with principles of Community law: Amendments Nos 10, 28, 36, 70 and 76. It is also the case of amendments trying to modify the scope of application of the directive in a manner which is not consistent with other information society service directives (Amendments Nos 27 and 63), and of Amendment No 31 changing the proposed definition of commercial communications.', 'Thirdly, because they would upset the balance of interests on a number of issues that has been achieved in the original proposal. Amendment No 48 belongs to this group; there was a question on that.', 'This is the case as regards the amendments on the issue of liability of intermediaries from 44 to 54 and 75. It is a very important sensitive area where particular effort was made in the original proposal to achieve a reasonable compromise solution that takes account of all interests at stake. It is also the case as regards Amendment No 71 narrowing down the list of contracts established in Article 9 of the proposal.', 'Fourthly, because they would be too ambitious at this stage given the level of Community integration. This is the case of amendments aimed at narrowing down the derogations in Annex 2 of the proposal (Amendments Nos 21, 68 and 74), and Amendment No 61 concerning court actions, although on this last issue the Commission recognises that there is a need to improve the possibilities of redress, especially in cross‐border contracts.', 'I would like to finish by again thanking Parliament for its work on, and its support for, the proposal. It will be of fundamental importance for Europe and its citizens to fully reap the benefits of electronic commerce and to strengthen the European position in the global context. I agree with Mr Paasilinna that all non‐governmental activities are welcome in this context.', 'President . – The debate is closed.', 'Since it is the season for goodbyes, I shall now say my own. In particular, I should like to tell my colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee how much I have appreciated the work we have done over the last five years, and to wish the committee every success in the next parliamentary term.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR GIL‐ROBLES\\nPresident', 'President . – Mrs Gebhardt has the floor on a point of order.', 'Gebhardt (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to express my annoyance, and annoyance is too mild a word, because I think it is outrageous that a report which was scheduled for this morning – at least that is what I was given to understand when we voted on the agenda on Monday – should now be postponed.', \"The report by a conciliation committee concerning the recognition of young people's vocational qualifications is a very important matter. As I discovered quite by accident this morning, the report is not to be debated until six o'clock this evening and the vote will take place tomorrow morning; this is not the sort of treatment that such a report merits, because it is about people, about young people. We in Parliament have said that this is one of our European policy priorities. I wanted to say that I do not accept the treatment meted out to this report, which is the product of extremely difficult negotiations in the conciliation committee and during the conciliation procedure with the Council.\", 'President . – Mrs Gebhardt, Fridays are as valid as any other day of the part‐session and as long as this is the case you should not assume the contrary. This matter was included on Friday\"s agenda by the Conference of Presidents a few part‐sessions ago and has never been planned for any other time. You should have spoken to the chairman of your group to see if it were possible to schedule it for another time.', 'In any case, on Friday mornings there is no special quorum requirement and we can vote on this matter quite calmly as no amendments have been tabled either. It is simply a matter of checking that there is consensus. Fridays are therefore just as valid and as important as any other day.', 'Medina Ortega (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, I should like to speak on a point of order. More specifically, I am referring to the order of voting for today.', 'Reports that require a qualified majority are usually voted on first. More specifically, the McCarthy/Hatzidakis report on the general provisions on the Structural Funds should be voted on before the implementing reports, particularly before the Varela Suanzes‐Carpegna report and the other implementing reports relating to the framework report on the Structural Funds.', 'President . – So, Mr Medina Ortega, what you are suggesting is that we proceed as usual and vote on the reports that require a qualified majority, in this case Mr Pronk\"s report, before voting on the group of reports on Agenda 2000.', 'Medina Ortega (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, I am referring to the group of reports including the Varela Suanzes‐Carpegna, Jöns, Kellett‐Bowman, Colom i Naval and McCarthy/Hatzidakis reports. The McCarthy/Hatzidakis report is the general report for these four reports and should therefore be put to the vote after the report by Mr Bösch and before the Varela Suanzes‐Carpegna report. This is a simple question of the order of voting as this is the general report and the other four reports are the implementing reports.', 'President . – No, the usual order has been followed for these reports: first readings, second readings, assent procedures and consultation procedures. If we go into which report is the general report, it will all become extremely complicated. The order has already been established and changing it now would only complicate matters.', 'Lulling (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, I am in the same embarrassing position as Mrs Gebhardt. I know that Friday is basically a day like any other: I am always here on Fridays. But you are setting a dangerous precedent, as Parliament needs to be given the opportunity to reject the results of a conciliation by 314 votes. That will not be possible. We have already done this once for the Rothley report. There had been a conciliation procedure, and we had agreed on the joint text, but Parliament rejected it. Tomorrow, Parliament will not be able to do that. I therefore protest, as we should have dealt with the conciliation reports this morning in order to be able to vote on them today.', 'President . – I am sorry, Mrs Lulling, but the vote on your report requires a simple majority and not a qualified one, otherwise it would have been included in the voting times today. That is why it can perfectly well be put to the vote tomorrow.', 'Lulling (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, I was not aware that conciliations could be treated differently according to their subject. I do not think that this is the case.', 'President . – No, there is no question of treating them differently according to the subject. Also, the Rothley report was rejected by a simple majority.', 'One needs to be properly informed before making comparisons.', \"Pack (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, let me come back to a point we discussed at nine o'clock this morning. As you will all have heard, Dr Ibrahim Rugova, the winner of our Sakharov Prize, has returned from Kosovo and is with his family in Italy. This morning, in your absence, we asked that the President and the Bureau should authorise a delegation from this Parliament to visit Dr Rugova in Rome at some time in the next few days. We suggested this morning that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Vice‐President Renzo Imbeni and the head of the Delegation for relations with south‐east Europe should travel to see him in order to find out from him how the situation looks in Kosovo, what has been done to him, and where things should go from here. We ask you to authorise this visit very soon so that we can make our travel plans today.\", 'President . – Mrs Pack, as you and all your colleagues are aware, the Conference of Presidents is responsible for authorising this journey. The Conference of Presidents is meeting this afternoon and I will put this request to them and recommend that it be approved. The competent body will therefore take a decision this very afternoon.', 'Mr Falconer wishes to speak on a point of order.', \"Falconer (PSE). – Mr President, on a point of order. Can you advise me as to whether those people who have telematic lenses have the Bureau's permission to take pictures from the gallery? Have they been granted permission to take these pictures?\", 'This point was raised at the last part‐session and those people were removed from the gallery, as is only proper and right.', 'President . – Mr Falconer, Parliament\"s services tell me that the photographer who is taking photos has been expressly authorised to do so and is therefore wearing a badge that shows he has been granted permission. Therefore, if our relevant services have authorised this, it is because it is permitted in the normal run of things.', 'McCarthy (PSE). – Mr President, I do not agree with your interpretation of how we take the vote on the structural fund programme, because the general regulation is actually the regulation governing every other aspect of the implementing regulations. If this House does not give assent to the general regulation, there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it. In terms of legislative logic you need to take the general regulation first, even though that involves only assent, and take the regulations thereafter.', 'All you need to do is swop McCarthy and Hatzidakis with Varela Suanzes‐Carpegna and then we can follow on logically.', 'President . – Mrs McCarthy, I do not see that there is any difference, but so that we do not waste any more time, we are going to vote as you requested. This will stop us using up any more time in a meaningless discussion.']}, {'topic': '4.

On behalf of the members of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to make the following statement. Until the present time, the standard practice of this House has been to decide on interinstitutional agreements by a qualified majority. This means that we reach an agreement on the basis of the last sentence of Article 203(9) of the EC Treaty, which states, in connection with the maximum rate of increase, that ‘another rate may be fixed by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its members and three‐fifths of the votes cast'.\", 'You know as well as I do that neither the Treaty nor our Rules of Procedure – not even the new Rules – regulate the question of voting on interinstitutional agreements. In this interinstitutional agreement and in the financial perspective, however, we are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years. We are thus indirectly taking a decision for which the Treaty explicitly prescribes an absolute majority. Not only for that reason, but also because of the political need for such a decision to be utterly binding on the Council and the Commission and on Parliament too, I would therefore ask that we proceed on the assumption that this vote requires a qualified majority. May I ask you to confirm that?', 'President . – Thank you very much, Mr Samland. I cannot confirm what you are saying. I have in fact examined the report by the Committee on Budgets in great detail and I have asked the Legal Service to give its opinion. As mentioned in the note your committee sent – which I have examined in great detail – and as you have indeed said, it is not stated either in the Treaties or in the Rules that interinstitutional agreements require an absolute majority. What is more, as you are all aware, a past ruling by the Court of Justice from 23 July 1988 states that the majorities required for a decision cannot be stipulated by each institution. This was what forced us to replace in our own Rules the absolute majority, which was used to grant discharge, with a simple majority instead. We came to the conclusion that it was not possible to maintain an absolute majority system when it was not enshrined in the Treaties. This would be an appropriate argument in this instance.', 'Along with the Legal Service, I have also examined the argument you have put forward on whether or not this decision in itself covers budget decisions, in other words, whether or not it covers budget decisions which, according to Article 272, require a qualified majority. I agree with the Legal Service\"s conclusion that it does not cover budget decisions because the agreement is neither a rule nor a budget decision in itself. Each year, when the budget is adopted, the President must verify that a sufficient majority has been achieved and has been taken into account. Then, when the annual budget is adopted, the decision is taken with these majorities. And you may take a decision that is theoretically contradictory not to reduce certain lines, even though the institutions may have adopted the agreement among themselves. This agreement does not have the force of law and is below the law. However, it is an agreement that is based on the goodwill of the institutions and it has no regulatory value.', 'As a result, we cannot demand a qualified majority if the agreement has no legislative or budgetary value. And there are rulings by the Court of Justice that confirm this point, which are also quoted in the Legal Service\"s report which I will make available to you.', 'Therefore, taking all these factors into account and to avoid making a mistake that might mean we could be brought before the Court of Justice and then lose – as has already occurred on a previous occasion – there is no other solution but to adhere to the Legal Service\"s criterion, which states that this vote requires a simple majority. It will therefore be decided by a simple majority only.', 'Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, I naturally agree with those arguments since, on the basis of my own examination, I expressed them this morning and yesterday in the Group of the European People\"s Party.', 'I would like to remind Mr Samland, who used a political rather than a legal argument, that this House has often called on the Council to do away with unanimous and qualified majority voting and to adopt agreements by a majority.', 'It is a strange political move to ask the Council to do something that we apparently do not wish to respect. This goes against the Treaties, our own Rules of Procedure, the case‐law of the Court of Justice and even common sense, which tells us that, in legal terms, an act is an act and only has the value of that formal act. It does not have the value of its consequences, which do indeed exist but which will eventually have an appropriate legal form, with the majorities required by the Treaty.', 'President . – I will not go into political criteria. The President must act in strict accordance with legal and regulatory criteria.', 'Dell\"Alba (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, first of all thank you for that clarification: we must deal with things on the basis of the law and from a legal point of view. We have to be very careful, because if we act on the basis of political considerations, we change everything, we can keep contradicting ourselves. We have already seen that this week.', 'I think that we need to take this fact into consideration: interinstitutional agreements alter budget annuality, by agreement of the institutions, and they are an integral part of a vision of the budget that we have accepted by mutual agreement.', 'In the Colom i Naval report, one paragraph and also Amendment No 27 directly relate to Article 12 of the interinstitutional agreement, an article which alters the maximum rate of increase for the duration of the seven year period. This is an extremely significant and extremely strong act on the part of this institution. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of Article 3 in Annex IV of our Rules of Procedure require an absolute majority of Members. I think that Mr Samland\"s objection is well founded. We are protecting ourselves from the Council by demanding that there should be an absolute majority.', '(Applaus)', 'Müller (V). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the line of argument advanced by Detlev Samland and to add the following comment: the case‐law you have quoted, Mr President, derives from a judgment which states that the institutions may not relax the provisions on required majorities which have been adopted in the Treaty. This does not, however, mean that the institutions are not autonomous enough to decide to increase the required majority in a particular situation, for example in order to enhance the binding effect ascribed to the maximum rate of increase in Article 203. This is a further argument in favour of the position taken by the Committee on Budgets. We are making a change here and are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years. The House would do well to ensure that this decision carries the support of a qualified majority.', 'Colom i Naval (PSE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, I should firstly like to note that, according to what you are saying, the Legal Service and the President made a mistake in 1988 and 1993 because, by following the Legal Service\"s report at the time, it was understood on both occasions that a qualified majority was required and it was put to the vote in that way. But what concerns me now, as I would of course be prepared to correct the error, is your own interpretation of the issue, Mr President. This is because the agreement we are voting on, as it stands at the moment, provides for the revision of the financial perspectives themselves by qualified majority. According to the opinion you have expressed, this act would be null and void and would be at odds with the 1988 decision you mentioned. Therefore, we could not adopt an act which, from what you are saying, is invalid according to the July 1988 decision.', 'Bourlanges (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, I would first of all like to pay tribute to Mr Samland, who we know is in favour of the interinstitutional agreement, and who puts concern for the law and for the political authority of interinstitutional agreements before any other consideration.', 'Mr President, if your interpretation is correct, the interinstitutional agreement is inadmissible because it contains a whole series of provisions which require a qualified majority. If the Treaty really does have to specifically require a qualified majority on every occasion, and limit the cases in which the qualified majority can be extended, then this interinstitutional agreement is inadmissible, as Mr Colom i Naval has just said. It is void, and you must withdraw it.', 'On a more fundamental level, I think that the main issue in this matter is that this Parliament, on its last day, intends to bind its successor and its successor\"s successor to a fundamental limitation of the budgetary powers laid down in the Treaty, budgetary powers which this Parliament mainly exercises by qualified majority. It is totally unreasonable and contrary to the Treaty to make a decision by simple majority, as the Treaty states that we have budgetary powers and that we exercise those powers by qualified majority. We cannot constrain the next Parliament and prevent it from exercising its budgetary powers by a simple majority agreement.', 'I would like to add that this agreement follows on from the institutional agreement of 1993, which was agreed by qualified majority and which explicitly states that it can only be revoked by qualified majority. This new agreement implies the former agreement being revoked and replaced and it must therefore be passed by qualified majority.', 'In short, Mr President, at the meeting point of the political and the legal, I think that you are grossly under‐estimating the significance of the emergence of interinstitutional agreements in our system. In ruling after ruling, the Court of Justice, which you cited, is increasingly recognising interinstitutional agreements as fundamental rules. What you are doing – if you pass this law by simple majority – will mean that, tomorrow, on a misty Friday morning, with a majority of 48 votes to 47, a makeshift Parliament will be able to abolish and destroy not only the financial perspectives, but the entire structure of interinstitutional cooperation that has been put in place over the last twenty months.', '(Applaus)', 'You do not have the right, Mr President, to wipe out in this manner something that is one of the foundations of sound interinstitutional operation, namely these agreements which have been drawn up gradually and confidently by the institutions. We must vote by qualified majority. Loyal cooperation between the institutions is at stake, as laid down in the Treaty and recognised by the Court.', '(Loud Applause)', 'President . – I have many requests for the floor but I do not believe that we are here to hold an academic debate; we are here to vote. Someone must decide, and this responsibility falls on my shoulders. I have studied the matter in detail and I am terribly sorry, Mrs Müller, but our case‐law states exactly the opposite of what you are saying: it states that we cannot increase majorities. It is not that we cannot reduce them but we cannot increase them. And therefore, where there are none, we cannot establish any. This is unfortunately how it stands, despite the fact that Parliament is sometimes under the illusion that it may be otherwise. On the basis of this decision, I have no other alternative but to stick to the criterion that had been reached. And we are going to vote by simple majority.', 'Let us consider the motion for a resolution. No, Mr Elles, this issue has been dealt with. I am terribly sorry. If anyone asks me in writing, I will pass this matter on to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure for future reference. But at this moment in time, someone must decide. It is my responsibility and I have decided. There will be no vote on this issue.', 'Fabre‐Aubrespy (I‐EDN). – (FR) Mr President, before we come to the vote on the revised Amendment No 27, I would like to question its admissibility. As this amendment establishes the adoption, in the form of an annex, of a draft interinstitutional agreement, I do not think that it corresponds – either legally or in practice – to what is expected in that context.', 'When we have had to vote on interinstitutional agreements, we have had a report and we have had the approval of the interinstitutional agreement, which was proposed in the report. I am not arguing about issues of majority. I expressed my position concerning the interinstitutional agreement on the CFSP, and my position has not changed.', 'However, we are talking about adopting the text of an agreement – one which considerably alters several parts of the report, albeit only a few paragraphs apart from the explanatory statement – by means of an amendment, following a report which has a different title: I do not think that this amendment is admissible. Moreover, you took this position in a relatively similar context concerning an amendment that I had tabled myself.', 'Samland (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, at its meeting on Monday, which was authorised by you and was properly convened, the Committee on Budgets took its basic decision on the adoption or rejection of the interinstitutional agreement. A majority of the committee voted for adoption. Since we could not vote before Monday on the resulting amendments and since you had specially authorised us to meet then, because the trialogue at which we negotiated the outcome with the Council only took place last week, the committee adopted the relevant amendments immediately after voting for the agreement. These amendments were properly adopted and were presented to the House within the prescribed time‐limit. In that respect, the House is behaving absolutely correctly by proceeding to the final vote now.', 'President . – Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy, the truth is that I see no precept in the Rules of Procedure that prevents us from proceeding in this way, just as we have done so many times. In other words, we can include a related text with an amendment. Therefore, I will now put Amendment No 27 to the vote.', 'Fabre‐Aubrespy (I‐EDN). – (FR) Mr President, forgive me for taking the floor again, but before the final vote and pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to propose that the Colom i Naval report be referred back to committee.', 'I think that the discussion that has just taken place, the arguments that were put forward and the conditions in which the vote took place are all arguments in favour of a referral back to committee. We would therefore be able to leave the next Parliament to decide, immediately after it has been elected, what is going to happen in the next seven years.', 'Meanwhile, we will have the opportunity to broach the legal question raised by several speakers, which Jean‐Louis Bourlanges explained brilliantly a moment ago. I therefore propose to the House to vote for the Colom i Naval report to be referred back to committee.', 'President . – Very well, we shall discuss that with one speaker in favour and one against. You were in favour. Mr Samland is against, I think.', \"Samland (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, for two years we have been discussing this report in committee – yes, for two years! We have presented more than twenty working papers on it. At Monday's meeting of the Committee on Budgets we had another four‐hour debate, in which Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy chose not to participate. Yesterday we discussed this report comprehensively here in Parliament. So with all due respect, we can support the report or oppose it, but any move to refer it back would truly be a slap in the face for the rapporteur and the House after all the work they have done. I move that we proceed to the vote.\", 'Elles (PPE). – Mr President, we heard yesterday evening in the debate on this report that our rapporteur himself is not in favour of this particular report. We have had votes this morning, under the new Amsterdam procedure, in which we have not been able to take individual amendments like Amendment No 28 which would call for a review clause for this perspective which extends – as some speakers have already said this morning – over seven years without any review. There will be no possibility for a new Parliament and a new Commission to have their say on the matter.', \"I therefore support the suggestion of Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy to send it back to committee. We are in the process of negotiating. We can clarify what is in Parliament's interests. I fear that if we take this final decision now, Mr President, you will be left with a kind of feeling that you have been acting on behalf of interests outside this House and not the interests of Members themselves.\", '(Murmurs of dissent )', 'President . – We are going to vote, Mr Elles.

I personally find it hard to comprehend that the Council should be presenting us with its amended position before it has consulted with the Committee of the Regions to clarify the role it intends to assign to the Committee. That is an unacceptable error of law. Secondly, this morning it was still impossible to obtain the correct version of my report from the distribution counter. The version that was available there this morning for the second reading still indicated the wrong legal basis, namely the Maastricht Treaty.

It may be separate, but it has a determining role in that its aim is economic and social cohesion, one of the missions of the European Union. This is why there was a need to revise its basic regulations, notably by redefining the key terms and in particular the actual concept of the project, as the Commission\"s proposal suggests. I also support the idea of simplifying financial management, and I feel that it is essential to ensure that the Member States take responsibility for the Fund, and to monitor the use that is made of the subsidies granted from it, as otherwise the risk of fraud will be increased.', 'With regard to the Structural Funds in general, the Council regulation only envisaged three Community initiatives (Interreg, Leader and EQUAL). The European Parliament managed to reach a compromise with the Council concerning the inclusion of a fourth initiative, URBAN. I welcome this. This initiative, which began life several years ago, has demonstrated how essential it was in urban areas in crisis.', 'More specifically, concerning the ERDF, the rapporteur opted for the reasonable solution by not altering our first reading of the Council proposal. For your information, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the extension of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament intends to change its position on 49 first readings under the cooperation procedure and on 15 texts adopted at first reading under the cooperation procedure. The European Parliament only intends to uphold its opinion on three regulations resulting from Agenda 2000, including the one that we are debating today. In this case this is due to the need to move this forward rapidly. With the same aim, the rapporteur has proposed compromise amendments to prevent the reform from being blocked. I think that these amendments (measures in favour of island regions, expanding the ERDF\"s scope of research, support from the ERDF for the URBAN and Interreg Community initiatives) are appropriate, and I support them.

We managed to have it adopted by the plenary session in Strasbourg on 19 November 1998, and we had to get it accepted by the Commission and the Council.

This is why I will vote in favour of this report and all of the reports that are part of the Agenda 2000 package. The 2000‐2006 perspectives can now be launched. Parliament is therefore ending this legislature by tying up this issue, one which is paramount for the future of Europe and of enlargement. It has been a long, arduous and difficult battle, sometimes strewn with obstacles, but it has always been an exciting one, and I am pleased to have been a part of it.', 'des Places (I‐EDN), in writing. – (FR) The reform of the Structural Funds does nothing to make up for the shortcomings of regional policy. It will not help to improve economic and social cohesion. It will result in a particularly damaging breakdown of regional policy, notably to the detriment of several rural areas of France.', 'We will not waste any time on considering and weighing up each of the measures, which are more or less welcome, that are contained in the general regulation. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations intends to question the supposed benefits of costly Structural Funds, which are tools used by the Commission to gain political favour in order to serve a centralist Europe.', 'In this respect, the reform of the Structural Funds has resulted in another increase in funding: ECU 195 billion for structural policy, ECU 18 billion for the Cohesion Fund and ECU 49 billion for the pre‐accession instruments. The Objective 1 regions get the lion\"s share, with 69.7\\u2009% of structural funding, compared with 11.5\\u2009% for Objective 2.', 'Everyone is competing to be the most eloquent in demanding more funding, but no one is questioning the effectiveness of the money spent. What is there to say about a budgetary approach which consists of fixing a spending objective rather than a ceiling for spending, seeking out projects at all costs in order to spend all of the funds that have been approved, rather than allocating funds to existing projects? Spending is becoming an end in itself and the measure of the programme\"s success.', 'It may also seem strange that during the negotiations Objective 2, which is dedicated to industrial and rural regions undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed, to the benefit of Objectives 1 and 3: its budgetary envelope will be ECU 22.5 billion for the 1999‐2006 period, which is more or less the same figure as for the 1994‐1999 period. Rural regions eligible for Objective 5b will be among the main victims of this situation: in France, one third of the population eligible under this Objective will no longer receive structural funding after the transition period.', 'The future of rural areas seems to be all the more uncertain given that the Commission and Parliament, always concerned with seizing new fields of competence for themselves, plan to develop an integrated urban policy, in contempt of the principle of subsidiarity. The Orlando report, which was hastily adopted on Tuesday without even being put to the vote, echoes President Prodi\"s investiture speech in calling for this European policy for cities. Once again, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations would like to reiterate its desire to see the European Union concentrate its efforts on the existing common policies (the CAP, the CFP, etcetera) rather than spreading itself across an ever greater number of sectors, with a danger of worsening the inevitably inefficient scattering of public funds and encouraging an increase in public spending, which is always harmful.', 'This is not the only anomaly in the reform of the Structural Funds. Many regions are benefiting from special treatment, as a result of political bargaining that has enabled them to escape the rigour of joint decisions. Only three countries are left out of this: Luxembourg, Finland ... and France. The case of the Belgian Hainaut is significant. It is receiving an additional allocation of ECU 15 billion in order to compensate for the loss of its eligibility for Objective 1, while the French Hainaut, which borders on it, is receiving nothing; this discrimination is not justified either by the GNP or by the level of unemployment in the two regions.', 'This example is quite a good illustration of France\"s position at the end of the negotiations on Agenda 2000. Having been undermined by Germany with regard to agricultural issues, France\"s position on regional policy has been manipulated, while it is also unable to maintain the position that it had within the CAP.', 'The reform of the Structural Funds is a failure: a failure for Europe and a failure for France. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations therefore had no choice but to reject the McCarthy‐Hatzidakis report.', 'Klass (PPE), in writing. – (DE) Structural policy has now developed into one of the main elements of Community policy. About a third of the Community budget is spent on structural support measures.', 'We all agree that European structural support cannot be spread evenly across all the regions of Europe. This implies a reduction in the number of regions considered worthy of support, and hence in the target areas for assistance from the Structural Funds.', 'It is a good thing that we have created a phasing‐out period for regions, such as many of the Objective 2 areas, which are set to lose their eligibility for support; this will prevent the abrupt termination of programmes that have started well. However, the support for rural areas for which we had campaigned was not introduced. We do have the Leader initiative, but that is only a drop in the ocean. Measuring rural areas in Europe against areas with high population densities is the wrong approach. The measures of hardship in rural areas are the absence of particular infrastructural facilities and the disadvantages deriving from the economic and social structure. These shortcomings create a vicious circle, because a lack of infrastructure means a lack of jobs.

Euro money was a key element in transforming the old Manchester docks at Salford Quays into a vibrant commercial centre, creating over 4, 000 jobs.

To this end it is necessary at all levels to enhance cooperation between regional and local authorities and socio‐economic operators, those closest to the changing world of the regions; it is also necessary, however, to take account of the competitive differences between regions because of the different levels of employment, quality of infrastructures, the natural environment and development, in particular during the sensitive stage that is just starting with the selection of regions which are eligible under Objective 2.', 'In general terms we are in favour of reform, but we have a few reservations about aspects which have not yet been explored in sufficient detail, such as, for example, the impact on regions which, for the sake of the principle of concentration, run the risk of seeing their development process come to a standstill.

Our contempt for the agreement was not a reflection of a contempt for cooperation. It reflected our contempt for a risky and excessively restrictive seven‐year financial programme.', 'I repeat what I said a moment ago: I simply regret the fact that the vote took place under circumstances which mean that this agreement is tainted with uncertainty and which mean that it is at the mercy of any occasional vote from Parliament. I still say, Mr President, that on this point you did not help the cause of interinstitutional cooperation by favouring the voting rule that you chose.', 'Fabre‐Aubrespy (I‐EDN). – (FR) Mr President, I voted against the Colom i Naval report, in particular for the procedural reasons that were mentioned at the time of the vote and which I mentioned myself.', 'It is not acceptable for the report as presented by the Committee on Budgets to include an amendment that goes a great deal further than the object of the report itself. This is true to the extent that it has now been placed in an totally ambiguous situation, given that at the time when we considered the report in the Committee on Budgets on 29 April, there was no question of approving the text of the agreement.', 'I would like to add to what Mr Bourlanges said a moment ago, that institutional agreements cannot be considered separately. It is the entire procedure that is wrong. It is wrong, firstly because there is not an absolute majority, something which you yourself insisted on for the interinstitutional agreement of 17 July 1998 on the common foreign and security policy, an agreement that I fought along with my group. Secondly, it is wrong because the national parliaments have not ratified texts which add to, alter and refine the Treaties, sometimes to a considerable degree.', 'What Mr Bourlanges has just said concerning the budgetary aspect is therefore particularly true, but he should have extended his comments to all interinstitutional agreements.', 'Andersson, Hulthén, Lööw, Palm and Sandberg‐Fries (PSE), in writing. – (SV) We welcome the idea of a new interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline for the next seven years. Experience with the financial perspective over the period 1988 to 1999 has shown that annual budgets can perfectly well be implemented without conflict. It was also possible to adopt budgets which fell well below the revenue‐based ceiling of own‐resources. We believe in financial parameters for the annual budgetary procedure, particularly given the pre‐accession arrangements and the measures required in that context. It is important for the EU to ensure that it has the financial resources necessary for admitting the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus.', 'We support this proposal for a lower financial ceiling than that established in the CAP guidelines. The EU spends far too much money on an over‐regulated system of agriculture which is not sufficiently adjusted to today\"s environmental requirements. Reform of the CAP must be pursued. We also believe that the best way of funding European policy is by concentrating on those measures that are absolutely vital, rather then creating mini‐budgets which swallow up large amounts of the Member States\" money. We therefore support the Council\"s endeavour to produce a tight budget covering the whole period.', 'Cederschiöld and Virgin (PPE), in writing. – (SV) Since we seek budgetary restraint as far as the EU is concerned and advocate a lean financial perspective with well‐founded priorities, we oppose the suggested increases in the EU\"s budget for the coming years.

I could add that the Cohesion Fund contributed to the conjuring trick that made some Member States into miracles of monetary union.', 'The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, which fought against the very principle of the single currency, must consequently have reservations about the Fund and the use that is being made of it. The policy of redistribution, when taken to such extremes, has overwhelming repercussions for the economy, as it weighs down private initiative with the burden of obligatory deductions.', 'Moreover, there are serious faults in the Cohesion Fund: in particular, its efficiency is questionable and there are financial irregularities in the way that funds are used.', 'In addition, it is a tool for federalist redistribution, whose aim is more to gain support for the Commission among the beneficiary Member States and their people rather than to enable them to overcome their difficulties.', 'The only merit of the Cohesion Fund is that it is allocated to Member States and not to their regions, as is the case with the Structural Funds.', 'The launch of the single currency is in danger of worsening the imbalances between Member States and causing an increase in relocations, either towards states or regions that are more competitive than others, or away from regions that are in difficulty towards the dominant economic centres that we are already seeing emerge (north‐west Germany, the Benelux countries, Ile‐de‐France, northern Italy). In this context, the Cohesion Fund will perhaps enable us to limit the damage done by EMU, but it will nevertheless fall very far short of what is needed.', 'This is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations could not vote in favour of the Collins report.', 'Schroedter (V), in writing. ‐ The Green Group votes against the recommendation on the Cohesion Fund Regulation because most of the innovative requests expressed by the European Parliament in the first reading aiming to strengthen and integrate the role of the Cohesion Fund within the European structural policy have not been taken into serious consideration in the new regulation.

At the end of my mandate, in May 1999, my political positions on social issues such as agriculture, food, rural development and the environment remain the same. The reform of the CAP was necessary, but not in the form proposed in Agenda 2000 by the European Commission. In our debates we have demonstrated a certain level of consensus on what we now call the ‘European agricultural model\", which on many points is at odds with the ultra‐liberal aims of the countries of the Cairns Group and of the United States.', 'I therefore voted against the reports which had not been sufficiently amended by Parliament and which therefore lose their meaning and substance. What is more, some rapporteurs share my position.', '1. The Görlach report as it stands, with a budgetary allocation that is far too small, does not allow the implementation of a real policy of rural development, which is more necessary than ever in order to guarantee a worthy and lasting future for the rural areas of the EU (80\\u2009% of EU territory).', '2. The Mulder report mentions in a recital the possibility of cofinancing, which we opposed because in the long term it would mean the destruction of the CAP and of the objectives of the Treaty.', '3. The Graefe zu Baringdorf report did not allow for a coherent mechanism to reorganise and limit agricultural aid according to social and environmental criteria, and following the amendments adopted in committee, the rapporteur himself will probably not recognise an amended text which is too far removed from his original text.', '4.

I was pleased to see that the majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development came to the same conclusions as I did. This is why no amendments to the Commission\"s proposal were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.', 'All of the French members of the Europe of Nations Group voted against the legislative resolution, bearing out the Berlin agreement on this point.', 'European agriculture is in a very bad situation. The price of agricultural products is falling steadily, as the principle of Community preference gradually disappears. The globalisation of trade in agricultural products is not an empty word, but a reality that our farmers are experiencing.', 'The forthcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organisation lead me to fear the worst for the years to come. Did Commissioner Fischler not say yesterday in this House that he envisaged a fresh reform of the common agricultural policy in 2003? The fact that the date given in that statement coincides with the end of the negotiations in 2003 is surely not a coincidence.', 'Direct support for farmers is necessary, and it is essential for some sectors of agriculture. For example, the sector that currently receives the most aid is sheep farming. It is completely absurd, given farmers\" level of income, to try to put a ceiling on aid and to reduce it steadily. In France, sheep farmers have the lowest income among farmers.', 'A direct and across‐the board reduction in compensatory aid will therefore upset the balance in European agriculture. The only European producers that will survive will be those who are most competitive at world level.

We have reintroduced it into the second Martin report, because we cannot give up our hope of contributing to public health in the European Union by extolling the benefits of moderate wine consumption to the peoples of our countries who are unaware that wine is actually the best and most pleasant preventive medicine for Alzheimer's, cancer and senility, to name but a few malignant and debilitating diseases.\", '‐ Pronk recommendation for second reading (A4‐0155/99)', 'Skinner (PSE), in writing. ‐ The European Parliamentary Labour Party is in opposition to Amendment No 7 of the report because it has unnecessary repetition of existing EU legislation and lack of specific clarity on the issue of adaptation of machinery or replacement of all machinery whether or not it was practical to do so.', '‐ Oddy report (A4‐0248/99)', \"Iversen, Kirsten Jensen and Sindal (PSE), in writing. – (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of a proposal on electronic commerce which will safeguard consumers' interests on the Internet and at the same time remove barriers for service providers that are established in the EU.

It is an advantage for the Internet industry that they are subject to regulations in their home country, since they then know the rules. Conversely, it may be a problem that the consumers do not know the rules. We have therefore voted in favour of increasing the rights of the consumer, including a requirement that the Member States must take measures to ensure that consumers can have themselves entered in an opt‐out register, which the service provider must then check regularly. As a general principle, the Danish Social Democrats are working to ensure the strictest possible EU minimum requirements with regard to marketing on the Internet.

The negotiations between the parties to the agreement will not be concluded until late in the year. To accept the Commission's proposal regarding the content of the agreement at this point will therefore be tantamount to giving the Council and the Commission a blank cheque for the negotiations. We wish to see the final result before we reach a decision on the extent to which we can support it.\", \"The Commission's proposal for the agreement is a distinct improvement on the present framework agreement on cooperation, dating from 1991, which it is to replace. In particular, the democracy clause (Article 1) is an important step forward. What is lacking, however, is a clear specification of the mechanisms that are to be used to monitor the extent to which the parties are respecting human rights. Without such mechanisms, the clause is essentially useless. Bearing in mind Mexico's continual infringements of human rights, this is wholly unacceptable. Moreover, the proposal does not contain any indications as to how the involvement of civil society can be promoted and how respect for workers' rights can be ensured.\", 'Howitt (PSE), in writing. ‐ Whilst congratulating and supporting the rapporteur and my esteemed colleague, Mrs Miranda de Lage in relation to her work on Mexico, as for Latin America as a whole, I have to record my personal reasons for voting against ratification of this agreement.', \"It is less than a year since Parliament ratified the Interim Agreement on the basis that the human rights clause it contained would be a test of the Mexican Government's seriousness in ensuring human rights cooperation was central to relations with the EU. We also expected that human rights issues would play a central role in negotiations between the Mexicans and the European Commission.\", 'Meanwhile the human rights crisis in Chiapas, southern Mexico, continues to deteriorate, and we have no evidence that the negotiations for clear mechanisms for the application and monitoring of the democracy and human rights clause have been included in the negotiations.', 'Our sister party, the PRD in Mexico and human rights NGOs believe it is premature for this Parliament to ratify the full agreement.', 'I share their view.', 'van Dam (I‐EDN), in writing. – (NL) The way this whole Mexico report has been handled has been deeply disappointing. By dealing with the proposal now, the European Parliament has not kept to what it said earlier. In its report of April 1998, Parliament said that it would not approve the overall agreement until it was clear exactly what it contained. At the moment, the European Union is in the middle of negotiations with Mexico, and the substance of a number of provisions in the overall agreement will not be established until the end of this year. We feel that Parliament has acted irresponsibly by voting on the report now, as this will simply be signing a blank cheque and we will have no further influence in the matter.', 'Apart from these procedural objections, there were also aspects of the substance of the report that led us to vote against the agreement with Mexico. The rapporteur has seriously misrepresented the human rights situation in Mexico. She talks about recent progress in the field of human rights and lists all kinds of formal measures that Mexico has taken. But in practice the protection of human rights in Mexico is still far from perfect, as we can see from the unlawful executions and the continuing gang warfare in Chiapas. The overall agreement contains no mechanisms for enforcing compliance with human rights.', 'Our second objection concerns Mexico\"s environmental policy, which the rapporteur does not even mention, although we and others provided her with information about it. The planned construction of an enormous new salt production plant threatens not just a Unesco‐protected nature reserve but also various species including the grey whale, which comes to these waters to calve. If Mexico persists with these dangerous plans, then despite the trade agreement we must keep the option open of imposing a trade boycott in the form of an import ban on Mexican salt.', '- Aglietta Report (A4-0169/99)', 'Berthu (I‐EDN), in writing. – (FR) The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations did not vote for the Aglietta report on the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, mainly because the European Parliament is seeking to distort the meaning of certain new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to alter the institutional balance to its benefit.', 'Although the Treaty of Amsterdam extended the scope of codecision between the Council and the European Parliament, it certainly did not make it the general rule. Above all, it did not modify Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which gives the European Council (and thus the hierarchy of the different Councils) the role of instigating EU policies, nor did it modify Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which gives the Council the sole responsibility for determining the implementing powers that will be conferred on the Commission. This being the case, even if Parliament increases its influence, it is clear that the Treaties still place the Council at the centre of the institutional system.', 'We therefore think that the Aglietta report, which claims for the European Parliament the right to interfere in implementing measures, particularly through the granting of the right to revoke a decision, contradicts the philosophy of the current institutions of the Union.', 'Moreover, it is questionable whether it is actually in the interests of the European Parliament to claim such a right. Due to the lack of distinction between a law and a regulation at European level, the European Parliament is already forced to spend a considerable amount of time on trivial issues. If it also had to take part in implementing powers, the situation would be even worse.', 'Bonde (I‐EDN), in writing. – (FR) I must first of all congratulate Mrs Aglietta on the quality of her work and the results that she has achieved in ensuring that the various committees involved in the process of adopting implementing powers are forced to be transparent.', 'The battle that I have been fighting since I was first given a mandate is finally bearing fruit, thanks to the perseverance of a rapporteur who has always been willing to listen and with whom I have had great pleasure in working.', 'The amendments made to the Commission proposal that the Council is prepared to accept considerably improve access to information on the Community decision procedures; these procedures are too secretive, whether they concern the work of the committees, the documents submitted, the agendas, the list of participants or the committees\" work schedule.', 'I also attach particular importance to the rule of adhering to the principle of making everything public, with confidentiality being the exception (Amendment No 31). I hope that once this principle has been laid down, it will not be reduced to nothing by a lack of serious motivation to determine the degree of confidentiality.', 'However, there are some criticisms to be made of other aspects of the report. They are the aspects that extend ad infinitum the scope of Community regulation, and which now call for a simplification of the existing procedures, following the bureaucratic and administrative obstructions that they have caused. We should remember this lesson when the Treaties are next revised and come to an agreement once and for all on the scope of Community powers.', 'Respect for the principle of subsidiarity would be a first step, but that does not feature in the report. On the contrary, this supposed simplification is a pretext for reinforcing the supranational dimension of the European Union. The Commission, which already has a monopoly on initiative, would thus seize executive power in Europe to become the government of the European Union, with the Council being reduced to the role of a second parliamentary chamber, making decisions by majority.', 'It is a step forward for the committees to be working in an open and transparent manner, but to cut them off from national concerns in carrying out their duties in order to put them under the power of the Commission is a mistake which I reject.', '- Resolution is Kosovo', 'Berthu (I‐EDN). – (FR) Mr President, like many people from France and other European countries, we are appalled by the increase in the exodus of Albanians from Kosovo and by the parallel escalation in NATO bombing.', 'This disastrous development of events, which is contrary to all the assurances that we were given at the start of the war, and contrary to the humanitarian objectives of the war itself, can only reinforce the doubts that we had expressed from the start concerning the strategy being used.', 'We feel that Europe is adding another error to this initial one, an error that has very serious consequences for the future. Both from listening to the speeches made by Members during the debate that has taken place in this House, and from listening to the speeches made by the President of France, I am struck by the fact that analyses of the deterioration of events only implicate Slobodan Milosevic personally, his family and his inner circle. Although their responsibility is undeniable, we cannot restrict the causes of the conflict to those people alone. On the contrary, it is clear that the conflict was born out of very ancient disagreements that are deeply ingrained in the various peoples that are involved.', 'What is even more serious is that this error of judgement is in danger of guiding us towards the wrong solutions. Implicating solely Slobodan Milosevic and his entourage insinuates that it would be enough to overthrow them in order for everything to be put right, for the Kosovar Albanians to return to their homes and for everyone to live in harmony in a multi‐ethnic Kosovo. In our opinion, this would be delusive, or at least it would take a long time and a great deal of effort to achieve it. However, if we are willing to recognise that there are deep‐seated quarrels involving the people themselves, and that these are difficult to eradicate in a short space of time, we will realise that we need to also consider other solutions, certainly including, for example, the partition of Kosovo.', 'We therefore call on the Heads of State and Government of the countries of Europe to rethink their strategy and to stop falling into line with the United States.', 'Ripa di Meana (GUE/NGL). ‐ (IT) Mr President, I voted against.', 'This war is governed by lies, unilateral propaganda, cover‐ups and omissions. To start with, there is the semantic confusion: the air war against the whole of Yugoslavia is described as the ‘situation in Kosovo\". The NATO aerial bombing of civilian targets – power stations, television headquarters, schools and buses – is defined as an ‘involuntary error\" or ‘collateral damage\". The reciprocal ethnic atrocities are always attributed to just one side and not to the others. In the documents approved by the majority in this House, there is no mention of the terrorist activity of the KLA, armed, financed, trained and politically adopted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.', 'And thus, although in the last few days some opportunities for negotiation seem to be emerging, with Ibrahim Rugova travelling freely to Rome and the three American soldiers being released, this Parliament, in its last few hours of work, opts to be led down the humiliating path of NATO propaganda with this vote on Kosovo, and fails in its political role.', 'Castagnetti (PPE), in writing. – (IT) I voted against this resolution because it contains no contribution from the European Parliament to help us get out of an avoidable, terrible, and to cap it all, ineffective war.', 'The resolution makes no reference to the glimmers of hope for a negotiated solution which have been appearing in the last few hours. There is no assessment of the absolutely trifling role played by Europe.', 'Finally, the resolution does not include the call for a targeted suspension of the bombing which emerged from the debate here in the House.', 'Eriksson, Sjöstedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), in writing. – (SV) Our party strongly repudiates the Milosevic regime\"s practice of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Milosevic bears a formidable responsibility for the persecution of the Kosovo Albanians. NATO\"s bombardments, however, have merely worsened and aggravated the situation. We believe that the bombing must stop immediately, in parallel with a Serb withdrawal from Kosovo. All refugees must be granted the right to return home under the protection of UN forces, comprising troops from neutral states and operating on the basis of a peacemaking mandate. Subsequently, an international conference on the Balkans will need to be convened under the auspices of the UN and the OSCE, the aim being to stabilise the situation in the region and to guarantee Kosovo a high degree of autonomy within existing borders.', 'In the light of our principled stance on this issue, we decided to vote against the resolution, which does not correspond to our position on a number of important counts.', 'Papakyriazis (PSE), in writing. – (EL) I shall be voting against the motion for a resolution on Kosovo because I believe that it offers no help whatsoever in our quest to find a political solution and in putting an end to this senseless war, especially now when, after 45 days, there are the glimmerings of hope of breaking out of this tragic impasse.', 'Furthermore, my position is underpinned by the following:', '1. My question to the Council H−0387/22‐4‐99 was considered, correctly and from a strictly procedural viewpoint, to belong to the general debate on Kosovo. However, this question remains unanswered and it is:', '‐ Is the Council aware of the allegations and reports in the international media that NATO bombing and the war in Yugoslavia have destroyed or irreparably damaged monuments forming part of the European cultural heritage, including Christian Orthodox monasteries and churches?', '‐ If these reports prove to be true:', 'a) what does the Council propose to do to stop this irredeemable loss and', 'b) what does it propose to do to repair the damage, as far as that is possible?', 'This question relates in particular to a ‘cultural war crime\" which is being committed in Europe, in Yugoslavia, where an ‘environmental war crime\" is also being committed.', 'The war in Yugoslavia, which is hypocritically and euphemistically referred to as a ‘humanitarian war\"(!!!), has caused major civilian losses and has exacerbated the tragedy of the refugees. This, of course, is the main issue and the main reason for demanding the immediate cessation of the bombing and the quest for a political solution.', '2. The same holds in respect of the draft motion for a resolution of 24 April 1999, which is:', 'The European Parliament:', '1. Unequivocally denounces and condemns the destructive bombardment of Belgrade Television (22 April 1999).', '2. Expresses its shock and sadness at the heavy human casualties (ten dead and dozens wounded) among the workers in the News department.', '3. Regards this as a barbaric attack against fundamental human rights, freedom of speech and expression, and freedom of the press.', '4.

That is a bad start. It is a typical reaction from technocrats to think that if they do not intervene, everything is going to dissolve into chaos. They do not consider the idea that there could be any other type of consistency than their bureaucratic consistency, for example, democratic consistency. On this false basis, the European Parliament\"s resolution, which is concerned above all with the preparatory work for future reform, proposes that the Commission should launch, and then steer, the process, and that, without relinquishing its supposed political responsibility, it should entrust the task of drawing up an initial document to a group of experts, a formula that was previously used in preparing for Maastricht.', 'We are absolutely opposed to this solution. These experts, described in the resolution as ‘independent\", are, as usual, going to be chosen in such a way that their conclusions will inevitably be oriented towards federalism. In any case, the very method of recourse to a group of experts, whether they are federalist or not, is to be criticised, because the document that they have prepared will serve as a basis for the discussions and those who wish to oppose it will be put at an immediate disadvantage.', 'The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes that the approach should be fully reversed and that the people should be given a say right from the preparation stage of the reform.', 'For a start, the national parliaments should all be consulted and all of their proposals together should form the basic document to be discussed by the Member States during the subsequent negotiations. The Commission, the supposed experts, and the European Parliament, who will all be colluding from the start in order to strip the national democratic authorities of a little more of their power, have no place in that process.', 'Delcroix (PSE), in writing. – (FR) Mr Biagio De Giovanni, chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, has succeeded in covering in a few paragraphs the main points that need to be made concerning the forthcoming institutional reform. I congratulate him on this achievement, as he did not sacrifice the content in order to achieve the desired level of conciseness.', 'I particularly welcome the fact that he starts by pointing out the importance of the investiture of the President of the Commission. Between Maastricht and Amsterdam, there have been significant modifications to the Treaties, and Parliament must take as much account of these as possible in order to ensure that their consequences are fully realised. During previous debates I had noticed that some of our colleagues had not yet registered Parliament\"s new role in this investiture. This was also the case for a number of members of the national parliaments. Fortunately, there has been a gradual raising of awareness during the debates and through contacts. This is why I am pleased that the main points are once again being set out here.', 'The new role of the President‐designate in constituting the College of Commissioners is close to that of what we in Belgium call a ‘formateur \": his point of view will count alongside that of the Member States. Also, the need for the President‐designate to present his political plans to the European Parliament – what Mr Romano Prodi rightly called his ‘programme of government\" – means that he must achieve a majority in Parliament on which he will base his actions. These new practices bring us closer to the situation that operates in our countries, and will be perceived by the people as a move towards democracy.', 'With regard to the forthcoming institutional reform, it is highly desirable that Parliament\"s voice should be better heard, and that, in contrast to the former method, which was extremely inadequate, reform should be based on real interinstitutional dialogue, something which is perfectly expressed in paragraphs 8 and 12 of our resolution. It is important that the opinions of the two legislative institutions of the Union should have equal weight, and consequently that the centre of gravity for decision making should be at an equal distance from the Council and from the European Parliament.', 'Palm (PSE), in writing. – (SV) The EU should in my view operate on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation. This report advocates giving a strong boost to the supranational dimension. It therefore runs counter to my convictions and does not have my backing.', 'Willockx (PSE), in writing. – (NL) I voted against the interinstitutional agreement for the following reasons. Firstly, the financial perspectives for the next seven years do not provide us with adequate financial resources for the effective social and democratic Europe that we wish to see.', 'Secondly, the flexibility instrument that was absolutely central to Juan Colom i Naval\"s reports has now become only a marginal element and can only be used if there is a qualified majority in the Council.', 'Thirdly, the European Parliament is not in a position at the moment to conclude an IIA with an outgoing Commission.', 'Finally, the way in which the President changed the vote on Amendment No 27 at the last moment from a qualified majority to a simple majority confirms his reputation as a manipulator.', '(The sitting was suspended at 1.31 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR GUTIÉRREZ DÍAZ\\nVice‐President', 'President . – Mrs Oddy has the floor on a point of order.', 'Oddy (PSE). – Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement. As you know I have just presented my report which Parliament kindly voted on this morning. This evening I will speak on the Malangré report as Socialist Group shadow. After the vote, when I returned to my office I found a fax from my Coventry office. This was a letter posted yesterday by the General Secretary of the Labour Party informing me that I had been suspended from my party. I am totally astonished by this, do not know what the reasons are and do not understand what I am supposed to have done wrong.', 'Consequently I need urgent clarification as to my rights and obligations as a Member of this House from the President. I wish to reassure the President that, in my view, my first duty is to Parliament and to my constituents and I shall carry on doing that to the best of my ability.', '(Applaus)', 'President . – Mrs Oddy, as you are well aware, Members\" duties are individual duties. The problems that may exist in each group, or within each group with the parties Members were elected to represent, are not related to the workings of Parliament itself. Therefore, I must tell you that your duties here are clearly as an individual and that you will remain in office, as long as you are not considering resigning. I must clarify this point as it is established in our Rules of Procedure, Mrs Oddy.', 'Mrs Pailler wishes to speak on a point of order.', 'Pailler (GUE/NGL). – (FR) Mr President, as our debate on topical, urgent and highly important matters is going to be largely dealing with human rights issues, I would like to inform the House about a relatively serious event which took place in Morocco involving a French national, Mrs Danze‐Serfaty.', 'The events took place after the official deadline for tabling resolutions on urgent subjects, which is why I am informing you of it today. Mrs Danze‐Serfaty is the wife of Mr Abraham Serfaty, who was imprisoned for 17 years in Tazmamart as a political prisoner, and who was received most honourably here following his release, notably thanks to Parliament\"s intervention and resolutions; however, Mr Serfaty can no longer return to Morocco, even though he is no longer accused of anything.', 'Mrs Danze‐Serfaty went to Morocco to request that the authorities allow her husband to return to his country and spend the rest of his days there. She was refused entry as soon as she arrived at the airport. I ask the President of Parliament to address the Moroccan authorities in order to protest against this refusal to grant entry to a French citizen and to demand that Abraham Serfaty be allowed to return.', 'President . – Mrs Pailler, as you know, there are certain deadlines established for the topical and urgent debate. For obvious reasons, you were unable to meet these deadlines. What you have said will appear in the Minutes, but I cannot take the matter any further at this stage.']}, {'topic': '5.

Far from being a safeguard against violence, the presence of the Indonesian army has continued to be a cause of the problem. If the result of the referendum on autonomy for East Timor, planned for 8 August with United Nations backing is to be accepted, the ballot must be held in fair and free conditions which Indonesian forces cannot be relied upon to guarantee.', 'Sadly, violence seems to be rising throughout the region and reports of yet another massacre this week by the Indonesian army confirm once again its reputation for ruthless violence. An independent United Nations backed force is required to ensure that voting in the East Timor referendum takes place in conditions free from violence and intimidation.', 'Political prisoners still have not been released, Mr Xanana Gusmão, one the leaders of the independence movement still under house arrest, should be granted full and unconditional freedom. The right of the people of East Timor to reject autonomy and demand full independence must be fully ensured.', 'In the European Parliament we have over the years consistently denounced the oppression imposed on the people of East Timor and their suffering at the hands of the Indonesian regime.', 'At the end of this Parliament it is important that we should reaffirm our support for these people and their rights and I am proud that in my last speech here I shall be doing precisely this.', 'President . – Thank you very much, Mr Newens. We are sure that, even though this is your last speech here, your work will continue to be as positive as it has been throughout this parliamentary term, as I have witnessed.', 'Girão Pereira (UPE). – (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Parliament can be proud of the role it has played during this parliamentary term and of its important part in finding a solution to the problems of East Timor. This issue has been addressed here many times during this parliamentary term and it has perhaps been one of the international policy and human rights issues most frequently raised in Parliament.', \"I believe that Parliament has done itself credit and has aided the Timorese cause. And it is strange that it should be right now, during the final days of this parliamentary term, that a solution for East Timor seems to be appearing at the end of the tunnel. The agreement concluded between Portugal and Indonesia yesterday in New York, under the auspices of the United Nations, is a ray of hope for a solution of this martyrised people's problems.\", \"However, although it has for the first time become clear in this agreement – and Indonesia is to be congratulated on this – that Timor's right to self‐determination and independence is recognised, I would like to emphasise, and someone must stress this point because it represents an important change of policy regarding East Timor which I sincerely welcome, that we also need to bear in mind the rather hypocritical behaviour already mentioned here.\", 'I say hypocritical behaviour because at the same time as this political stance is being adopted, the Indonesian army and the militias and security forces are continuing to arm men who are trying at all costs to prevent self‐determination. If leaders continue to be killed, if the population has to flee to the mountains and is afraid of voting, if the thousands of pro‐Indonesian people who were transferred to Timor last year are to have the right to vote, and if leaders like Xanana Gusmão are still to be kept under arrest, then I believe that it is impossible to hold a free and fair referendum for East Timor.', \"And that is the great challenge for the international community. In the agreement signed yesterday, Indonesia undertook that the safety of the people and the security of the referendum would be guaranteed by Indonesia itself. I have my doubts. Indonesia's recent behaviour does not give us great cause for hope here. I believe, Commissioner, that the United Nations and the European Union have an important role to play in ensuring that the Timorese problem is resolved justly.\", 'Ribeiro (GUE/NGL). – (PT) Mr President, the European Union has unequivocally supported the cause of the Timorese people and their inalienable right to self‐determination and independence, and has from the outset made a significant contribution to ensuring that their struggle did not go unnoticed. We can therefore take some pleasure in the fact that we are concluding this parliamentary term by adopting positions which suggest this may actually happen. It is particularly felicitous that this is taking place at a critical point in the process, with the signing of the agreement reached under the auspices of the United Nations, which embraces the possibility of the Timorese people being able to freely determine their own future.', \"We welcome this victory for the Timorese people and we are delighted that our modest but insistent and solid contribution, which some people have signed up to only recently – be it opportunely or opportunistically – has been of some assistance. We are leaving this Parliament with a feeling that in this case at least we have done our duty as elected representatives. The cause of the Timorese people demonstrates that it is worthwhile fighting, that it is worthwhile to resist. Nevertheless, our satisfaction is somewhat diminished by our lack of confidence in Indonesia's policy and by the alarm it is causing. We must not lower our guard. And we must not forget that the referendum is not so much a happy ending as one more step – an important one – on the long road which will enable the people of East Timor finally to be masters of their own destiny, after centuries of Portuguese colonisation and a quarter century of brutal occupation by Indonesia.\", 'We must carry on demanding that the Indonesian authorities match this diplomatic decision with consistent practical measures. The process of disarming and dissolving the pro‐integration militias must be started immediately, and it is essential that Indonesia should demilitarise the territory so that the referendum can take place freely and democratically, and the referendum should be monitored and given credibility by the United Nations. We should also demand that all members of the Timorese resistance movement under arrest should be freed, in particular Xanana Gusmão, and that their participation in this process should be guaranteed, as should the safe return of those who have been exiled. We must also reiterate our condemnation of those countries which hypocritically hail human rights but do not hesitate to carry on selling arms to a regime guilty of genocide. That is what we have pledged to do within this Parliament and outside it.', 'Bertens (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, not so long ago we discussed the subject of Indonesia here in the House, and I said that we were very concerned not just about East Timor, but also about various other areas of what is the largest Islamic country in the world. I hope that the European Union and the United Nations will lend a helping hand to whatever government is in power in Indonesia.', 'East Timor is, of course, in a very special position because of its past, and the situation there is explosive, but the concern that we felt has possibly been slightly alleviated by the New York agreement between Portugal and Indonesia that various people have mentioned. The referendum on 8 August is vitally important, and both the European Union and the UN must do everything in their power to ensure that it is fairly and properly organised. It would appear to be absolutely vital to send in a UN policing force immediately. This would not just bring stability to East Timor, it could also have a positive influence on the entire region, or at least the immediate region of the Sunda islands, of which East Timor forms part.', 'Mendes Bota (PPE). – (PT) Mr President, the signing of the agreement between Portugal and Indonesia yesterday in New York under the auspices of the United Nations, an agreement on holding a referendum in East Timor with a view to self‐determination for the Timorese people, is a historic moment that we should welcome. This agreement is the culmination of fifteen years of diplomatic efforts and comes 23 years after the forced annexation of this former Portuguese colony where hundreds of thousands of people have died as victims of the civil war and of the brutal repression of the Indonesian army. Nevertheless, world history is littered with agreements and treaties that were not respected and led to nothing.', 'Because of the obstinate refusal of the Indonesian government, issues relating to security and the achievement of a climate of peace in which the people are free from coercion have not been properly safeguarded. The contingent of 600 UN representatives who are to organise and observe the referendum process consists of unarmed civilians, possibly supplemented by 250 police, also unarmed, without any means of defending anyone – including themselves – in the face of the activity of the pro‐integrationist militias who are spreading terror in Dili and the rest of the territory with impunity.', 'The natural leader of East Timor, Xanana Gusmão, has not hesitated to denounce as a historical aberration the suggestion that the Indonesian armed forces can be considered an impartial force. All the independent observers are unanimous in accusing the Indonesian army of conniving with the pro‐Indonesian armed militias and of being their main source of inspiration and supplier of arms and munitions. If an impartial military force cannot be guaranteed in Timor, the real choice in the referendum will not be between autonomy and independence, but between integration and staying alive. Furthermore, the intimidatory election campaign has already started: Indonesian flags have recently been flooding into houses in East Timor, and the inhabitants are being forced to wear badges bearing the Indonesian colours and to sign pro‐integrationist declarations. There is not much choice when you have a pistol pointing at your head.', 'The United Nations, the European Union and the international community in general must maintain pressure on Indonesia so as to force it to accept a military presence to guarantee the neutrality of the referendum and to stop this turning into a sham with fairly predictable and bloody consequences.', 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been my 150th speech in the plenary, and it will also be my last. So, in saying farewell, I would like to wish all those of you who, like myself, will not be continuing to sit in the hemicycle of the European Parliament, every personal, professional and political success in the future. And to all of you who will be continuing, I hope that you will be in the fortunate position next September of celebrating a great victory for the Timorese people, as a result of their freedom of expression in deciding their own future in a referendum which will take place on 8 August.', 'President . – Thank you very much, Mr Mendes Bota. I am sure that we all hope to be able to celebrate in September what you highlighted in the last part of your speech. And as you have said that this will be your last speech in this Hemicycle, allow me to wish you the very best for the future. I also hope that we will continue to have a good relationship so that, wherever we may be, we can cooperate as far as possible in the fight to complete the process of European integration and in our solidarity with all those who need our support. I wish you the very best of luck, Mr Mendes Bota.', 'Hautala (V). – (FI) Mr President, there has been a clear breakthrough, in international terms, in the situation in East Timor this year. It is quite correct, as my colleagues have stated here, that resolve on the part of the European Parliament has had its effect on this outcome. However, today, it has to be said, the situation is perhaps more explosive than it has been for a long time, as paramilitary activity has jeopardised the forthcoming referendum. We would all certainly call on the Commission to do all it can to defuse the situation in East Timor, so that the referendum on 8 August can be held in a peaceful atmosphere. For this to happen, the European Union should participate in an international effort to guarantee an international presence in East Timor. Australia has made significant proposals to the UN about this, and pledged to provide funding. Our task now is to consider what this presence would consist of – police forces operating under UN supervision, or perhaps peace‐keeping forces – and I would be very interested to hear the Commissioner\"s views on this.', 'The other important issue is that there are soon to be parliamentary elections in Indonesia, and preparations for the East Timor referendum are under way. We also surely need to send observers to monitor these events, not only official observers, but also representatives of voluntary organisations. I would like to hear if the Commission has made any preparations for this.', 'Finally, I would like to say that there has been a seamless bond of cooperation among the Members of the European Parliament on the question of East Timor. Hopefully, that will continue during the next term, and let us hope, meanwhile, that East Timor achieves independence.', 'Maes (ARE). – (NL) Mr President, East Timor is a typical example of an area where human rights are under threat, and there is daily evidence that the lack of international law and of genuine recognition of the right to self‐determination is producing some very dramatic situations. I hope that the new agreement will be a breakthrough, but at the same time I would join the previous speaker in urging that practical steps should be taken, including by the European Union, to ensure that appropriate pressure really is brought to bear. It is important to send observers, but it is also important for the UN to have a presence operating under appropriate instructions, because this is something else that is lacking and is creating increasing disillusionment.', 'I hope that after so many years of suffering, law and order can finally be restored, that the right to self‐determination will finally become a reality, and that the forthcoming referendum will give genuine democracy a chance instead of the increasing violence we are currently seeing in so many areas of Indonesia.', 'I do not know whether this will be my last term of office and whether this will be my last speech, but wherever I am, I shall continue to work with all those fighting for the right to self‐determination and human rights, because East Timor is only one of the many countries where war has been impossible to prevent. I hope that East Timor will prove to be an exception and will win its independence.', 'Barros Moura (PSE). – (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we should first of all welcome the agreement reached in New York yesterday between the Portuguese Government and Indonesia concerning East Timor. This is very much the culmination of a long process in which Parliament and the European Union have played their part, and in which the struggle of the people of East Timor has certainly played a key role, but at the same time we must pay tribute here to the importance of the diplomatic triumph achieved by the Portuguese Government yesterday in New York.', 'This agreement and its implementation should provide us with a basis for achieving the desired results, that is to say enabling the Timorese people to freely exercise their right to self‐determination and independence. This is why it is essential – despite what some Members might say – for us to recognise the importance of the commitment entered into yesterday that the referendum on 8 August should be held under the auspices of the United Nations and its Security Council. And that is also why in addition to the police force already mentioned here it should be possible to secure the presence of a security force.', 'I consider that this case once again confirms the diplomatic force of an argument which has recently arisen on the international political scene, namely that the international community cannot apply double standards. If the international community demands that human rights should be respected in Kosovo, then it has to be consistent and demand that they should also be respected in other parts of the world. I know that the Portuguese Government has deployed this argument very effectively and that it will continue to do so, just as we should carry on using it to persuade the European Union to use its full political powers and its scope for financial support to ensure that the process in East Timor goes smoothly.', 'This is the umpteenth time that we have discussed the issue of East Timor in the European Parliament. However, I feel that today our discussion is taking place in a climate of special political importance, because we are not just talking about a mere question of human rights but about a political issue. I would like to thank my colleague from the Socialist Group, Stanley Newens, whose persistence enabled us to get this point included on today\"s agenda.', 'van Bladel (UPE). – (NL) Mr President, I have to contradict Mr Barros Moura. The UN agreement that has been concluded does not talk about security forces, but only a civilian police force.', 'The referendum on East Timor on 8 August will be held under a new government, and if people reject autonomy and integration it will bring the prospect of independence closer. Xanana Gusmăo would like to see this, as would everyone else, and he has already said that he is going to need a great deal of help. I wonder who from – perhaps Australia, which is already stripping the territorial waters of minerals.', 'It remains to be seen whether this is in the best interests of the Timorese in the long run. If it becomes independent, it seems obvious that it will go back to the situation before 1975, with Portugal resuming responsibility for this island which it abandoned to its fate and offering East Timor the status of an overseas territory like Guadeloupe or Martinique. Timor could then benefit indirectly from EU assistance.', 'There are a number of general points I would like to make. After the collapse of Yugoslavia, the aspirations of the Kurds and the distinct revival of minorities and races, we should not be under any illusion about what East Timor\"s independence will mean for the Indonesian archipelago and the Asiatic region. If the new Indonesian Government does not succeed in holding the islands together, there is bound to be instability, with China emerging as the dominant factor in the region and other countries building up their stocks of weapons. In short, an independent Timor sounds all very romantic, and I also think that we need to be fair to the people of Timor, but in geopolitical strategic terms it would cause an imbalance. Do not forget that the largest Allied cemetery from the Second World War is in Indonesia, on Dili, which only goes to show just how strategically important the island is. I too believe that the people must have justice, and above all I think that Parliament must send observers after all the resolutions we have adopted.', 'Barros Moura (PSE). – (PT) Mr President, thank you for refreshing my memory about the relevant part of the Rules of Procedure. Mrs van Bladel did indeed refer to a point in my speech about the kind of force that the United Nations is to send to this territory. It is indeed a police force. But I wish to emphasise that placing the entire referendum process under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council will inevitably make it necessary for the appropriate security forces to intervene if Indonesia does not comply with its duty to disarm the militias and to ensure this process takes place without interference from armed terrorist groups. That is exactly why I see the agreement that has been signed in such a positive light – as I think we all should – and I wanted to explain that to Mrs van Bladel.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, the Commission naturally welcomes the fact that in the final round of tripartite negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations in New York, historic progress was made by the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments on resolving the longstanding, delicate and tragic problem of East Timor.', 'The Commission applauds the signing of the agreement in the early hours of this morning, as indeed you all do. This agreement establishes the framework for the territory\"s autonomy, the methods and organisation of the referendum and also security provisions.', 'In this respect, the Commission believes that the decision by President Habibie of Indonesia to approve the presence of United Nations observers is a step forward. These observers will supervise the referendum organised by the Indonesian authorities in East Timor. The Commission trusts that their presence will ensure that the referendum is held in a climate of peace, impartiality, freedom and security.', 'The Commission also believes that the establishment of a trust fund for this referendum by the United Nations is a positive step. And, in relation to this, I must report that this very week, and probably tomorrow, the European Union\"s financial contribution to this fund will be approved. This will provide a sum of EUR 1 million that will be aimed specifically at studying how the European Union can become involved in the process. You asked whether or not the European Parliament would participate as an observer during the referendum, as it usually does. In principle, this issue will have to be resolved by the Council of Ministers, which will determine how we should participate under the framework of the United Nations and with respect for the terms of the agreement between Indonesia and Portugal. In any event, the European Union\"s financial contribution to the trust fund is guaranteed.', 'Also, Mr Mendes Bota – as you and other Members highlighted, particularly Mr Newens – we do of course share your concern over the continued presence of armed militias. These militias are obviously interfering in the political process that is to lead to the referendum. As one speaker said, we will have to see how this matter can be resolved, although I would stress that within the agreement itself there are specific provisions on how to ensure and increase security. This is the United Nation\"s responsibility and I imagine that, through dialogue, organisation and the actual political implementation of the agreement, it will be possible to determine how to participate with security.', 'But how will this happen? One of the commitments in the United Nations agreement is to disarm the militias, as Mr Barros Moura pointed out. Disarming the militias is a promise that must be kept for the sake of security. We are convinced that Indonesia will have to make every possible effort to disarm the militias and, clearly, depending on how these efforts are received internationally, we will then be able to decide if corrective measures need to be taken, if there are sufficient police forces or whether more are needed and if we must send more international missions. At the end of the day, it is difficult at this stage to predict how the agreement signed in New York in the early hours of this morning will develop between now and 8 August.', 'In any event, as far as the European Union is concerned, I have already told you that provisions have already been made and I can tell you that more are to follow. More specifically, at the request of the Portuguese Government, we have already begun work on the need to step up cooperation with the region, irrespective of the outcome, whilst naturally respecting the will of the people.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Marín.', 'Mrs Maes has the floor on a point of order.', 'Maes (ARE). – (NL) Mr President, I wanted to ask Commissioner Marín whether he made those comments about the budget with a view to possible preparations for independence, if the majority of the people vote in favour of it.', 'President . – Mrs Maes, I must tell you that this is not a point of order. It is a supplementary question. I hope that Mr Marín will respond to your question, since we all know how courteous he is, and I, in turn, will be courteous and allow a point of order to become a supplementary question.', 'Mr Marín, I would ask you to respond to Mrs Maes.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, I would give up my life for this House.', '(Laughter)', 'I do not mind. There are two decisions. The first relates to the trust fund set up by Kofi Annan to carry out the whole referendum process, on the basis of the agreement between Indonesia and Portugal. The Council of Ministers asked the Commission to draw up an emergency contribution. This emergency contribution has been set at EUR 1 million and will be presented next week so that it can be operational immediately. I would imagine that there will also be donations from other countries: from the Member States, from the United States and from Japan. This trust fund must be used to guarantee security, organise the referendum, prepare the electoral colleges, and allow for international observation. If the United Nations believes that European observers are needed, this will be possible thanks to this trust fund.', 'However, over the past two years, a programme for humanitarian aid and emergency rehabilitation was established, based on the Council of Ministers\" common position. It was carried out through Caritas, because of the importance of the Catholic Church in East Timor and, in particular, of the Nobel Prize winner, Archbishop Belo. This was a programme used only for humanitarian aid for emergency rehabilitation. Irrespective of the outcome on 8 August, the Commission is already considering a plan that could in theory become a cooperation programme that would enhance our involvement.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Marín, for being as generous as usual.', 'Mr Marín, I am very well aware that you are prepared to give up your life for Parliament, but you are not in danger of losing your life; you are in danger of being skinned alive. There are parliaments that can sometimes tear a person to shreds. Therefore, with my extensive experience, I must warn you to be careful, Mr Marín. Be careful.', 'The joint debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.', 'President . – The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:', '‐ B4‐0460/99 by Mr Colajanni and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0479/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party', '‐ B4‐0486/99 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group', '‐ B4‐0488/99 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left', \"‐ B4‐0495/99 by Mr von Habsburg and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party\", '‐ B4‐0503/99 by Mr Gahrton and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the Middle East peace process and the 4 May 1999 deadline.', 'Colajanni (PSE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, Commissioner Marín, above all I would like to pay tribute to the Palestinian National Council, which has postponed the date of the unilateral declaration of independence scheduled for 4 May. It has made a gesture of political far‐sightedness and unilateral generosity towards the peace process, it has avoided a period of upheaval and a negative influence on the elections in Israel and a serious crisis in the peace process, with the danger of military conflict flaring up again.', 'This is what the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 11 March, in which, while recognising the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to found their own State, it considered it essential for the international guarantors of the Oslo agreements solemnly to reaffirm their commitment to achieving all the objectives of the peace process, thereby giving the Palestinian National Authority the support required to justify an extension of the period of application of the provisional agreement beyond the date of 4 May 1999.', 'And this is what the Palestinian National Council has done. It did so because – apart from the request made by this House – there was a commitment made by the European Council in Berlin. Let me quote what we say in the resolution, that Parliament ‘welcomes the statement issued by the Berlin European Council on the peace process, particularly the Palestinians\" unconditional right to self‐determination, including the right to create a State, which the European Union is prepared to consider recognising in due course, and the undertakings given by the European Union concerning the future settlement of the conflict.\"', 'I feel that all this is important; I believe that these commitments are binding and we should remember them. We must be faithful to them, and they will require a strong initiative to be taken by the European Union and the United States after the Israeli elections.', 'Bertens (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, the Palestinian authorities are to be praised for their decision to accept an extension of the transitional period beyond 4 May. By agreeing to this, they have shown that they still believe in the Oslo accords and the Wye Plantation agreement, and they have also shown their desire to prevent the peace process from becoming bogged down. Without it, an escalation in the conflict would have been very likely, but now the Palestinian decision may increase the mutual trust that is needed for a lasting peace. We are also pleased with the statement made by the Berlin European Council, as Mr Colajanni said, and these sorts of clear political signals could give the Union greater influence in the Middle East. Internal divisions in the past have meant that the Union\"s political influence has always been too weak. It has always been the biggest provider of funds, but giving money is obviously much easier than agreeing a common political line. It was significant that the agreement of 23 October 1998 showed that constant external pressure is needed to keep the peace process going. Since that interim agreement, there have been too many wrong signals from both sides, most of them from Israel, I have to say, including granting approval for the construction of more houses in Har Homa and Hebron.', 'In conclusion, I should like to ask the Commission, and in this case Commissioner Marín, what the situation is with the hospital in Gaza that is being built with European funding. During an earlier debate, the Commission told us that a management team had been sent to open the hospital at long last. I was just there, Commissioner, but I saw little evidence of it.', 'van Bladel (UPE). – (NL) Mr President, I too should like to know what Mr Bertens asked about the hospital, because I have also been there and it has been standing empty for far too long with no one using it. This is something we would find hard to justify to our voters.', 'I am pleased that the Palestinians have allowed common sense to prevail by refraining from declaring an independent state on 4 May. Generally speaking, there has been little violence in the region in recent weeks, and certainly none of the bomb attacks that Hamas was probably responsible for. It would appear that the escalating violence in the Balkans has brought the two sides in the Middle East up short, since everyone knows that this kind of escalation can lead to unpredictable situations. So for the time being, people on both sides are using their common sense.', 'However, the Palestinian position calls for an immediate and positive continuation of the negotiations with the Israelis after the elections. I also still think that a final positive outcome can only be achieved after agreements have been concluded with Syria and Lebanon.', 'I submitted a written question this week calling for an amnesty for 250 people illegally detained on Palestinian territory, but I have heard from your office that my question is not to be answered or published. I only hope that the Palestinian representative in the public gallery has heard my appeal, and that these people will be given access to the judicial process.', 'In recent times, we have paid frequent visits to the Palestinian territories under the leadership of Mr Colajanni. Progress has been made, but sadly not enough. A further initiative must be launched immediately after the elections to move everyone forward.', 'Elmalan (GUE/NGL). – (FR) Mr President, like my colleagues, I would like to say that, in order to protect the peace process, the Palestinians have demonstrated their good will by agreeing to postpone the date for the declaration of the Palestinian State, which the Oslo Agreement had set for 4 May. Meanwhile, the Israeli Government is continuing to violate its commitments and is increasing its provocation of the Palestinians by deciding to close Orient House in east Jerusalem and openly encouraging settlement, particularly in the West Bank. Was it not the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself, Ariel Sharon, who called on the settlers to take the hills in order to establish faits accomplis ? His call was heard, as new settlements are constantly being established.', 'Knowingly violating the Wye Plantation agreement of October 1998, which forbids any unilateral measures that could complicate negotiations on the final status of the territories, the Israeli Government is pursuing a deliberate strategy of draining the future negotiations of all substance and removing any possibility of the West Bank continuing as a territory, with the aim of preventing a future Palestinian state from being viable.', 'The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation. Along with my colleagues, I welcome the fact that the Berlin European Council recognised the Palestinian people\"s right of self‐determination and their right to establish a state. However, we need to go further than this and use all the political, economic and commercial means at our disposal to put pressure on Israel and to force the government to respect its commitments so that the two states can finally live in peace.', 'von Habsburg (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, I speak here above all as someone who believes himself to be a true friend of the State of Israel. A European who experienced the Second World War and Hitlerism will always have profound sympathy for the persecuted Jews – the more so in my case, because so many of my friends lost their lives in that catastrophe.', 'On the other hand, however, I have to say that my political thinking is governed by the principle that there must never be another war in the Middle East; a lasting settlement will never be achieved by force. So we must do everything in our power to bring about reconciliation between the Jews and Arabs. That is by no means impossible, for there are many Arab states, such as Morocco, where there is perfect understanding between Jews and Arabs. I have seen at first hand how the numerous Moroccan Jews in Israel are providing the most reliable bridge between Israel and the Islamic country of Morocco. It therefore makes good sense for us to table this sort of resolution at the present time.', 'There has been a great deal of talk about the fact that the Palestinian State was to be proclaimed on 4 May, and I am pleased that Mr Arafat, who has shown great statesmanship in this situation, declared his willingness to postpone the proclamation. On the other hand, we must not forget that elections are looming in Israel, elections that will be crucially important to the future of the region. There are Israeli statesmen who clearly recognise that Israel cannot live without the friendship of the Arabs, that failure to cultivate that friendship will result sooner or later in the destruction of Israel. There are those such as Shimon Peres or some of his colleagues in the Labour Party who really do follow a clear political line in that respect, and that is why we should now express the hope that the Israeli side will declare unequivocally that it desires peace and that it will now halt the various repressive measures which have been taking place with regrettable regularity since the seizure of power and since the appointment of Mr Netanyahu as Prime Minister will now stop. We hope that the people who come to power in Israel will be totally committed to turning the present situation around and working for reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, since therein lies the future of the region.', 'I believe that anyone who knows the Middle East will be aware that successful reconciliation will enable the region to flourish, and the various tensions that exist at the present time will then be no more than a sad memory of past intransigence.', '(Applaus)', 'Gahrton (V). – (SV) Mr President, the Palestinians have demonstrated admirable forbearance in not now doing what they have every right in the world to do, namely proclaiming a Palestinian state in accordance with the agreements which have been signed. Fifty years have passed since they were subjected to a similar fate to that afflicting the Kosovo Albanians today. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven out of their country, never to be allowed to return. The UN decided in 1947 that they should have their own state alongside the Jewish State of Israel, but they never got it.', 'For many decades, the Palestinians lived in the illusion that liberation would come either through intervention by foreign armies, or in the wake of their own sustained military struggle. This was not to be. Not until the Palestinians switched to non‐military methods, to civil disobedience through the intifada , to patient negotiations with an enemy perceived by them as fascist and racist – not until this happened did they begin to see signs of success. Now there is a peace process under way and, as a result, much of the world is willing to back their justified claims for an independent state.', 'I think that it behoves us to remember these lessons of the past, and I hope that the liberation of small peoples will in future come about according to the Palestinian method. I trust that this will be the norm, and that the Kosovo method will remain a deplorable exception in the history of the world.', 'I am a critic of the EU, but the Palestinian question is one which I think that the Union has handled in a constructive and positive fashion. I note with satisfaction the statement in principle that a future Palestinian state will be granted recognition. I hope that this actually happens once the Palestinians themselves decide to proclaim the State of Palestine.', 'Swoboda (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, the Palestinians have taken a courageous decision, and it is my wish that the Israeli Government – the present one and, I hope, its successor too – will take similarly courageous decisions, because we need a sovereign Palestinian State, we need the utmost respect for the sovereignty of Lebanon and Syria and, of course, for the sovereignty and security of Israel on the basis of a reconciliation process, as we heard from Otto von Habsburg, with whom I do not always entirely agree, but I am one hundred per cent behind him today.', 'However, the reason I asked leave to speak was to thank, on behalf of my group, two men in this Chamber who have campaigned tirelessly for the rights of the Palestinians in that same spirit. The first is Vice‐President Marín, whom we in this House have not always given an easy life – and nor has the Council, for that matter. Nevertheless, he has taken his decisions clearly and has pursued his aims, and for that I should like to express our very, very sincere thanks.', 'I should also like to give our special thanks to Luigi Colajanni, who has done a great deal on behalf of our group for the Palestinians and whom we shall miss, particularly for his commitment to the Palestinian cause. On behalf of my group, I wish him all the very best for his future work.', '(Applaus)', 'Vallvé (ELDR). – (ES) Mr President, I welcome this decision as an extremely positive one, just as I welcome the decision taken by the Palestinian Government not to unilaterally declare the creation of a state at the beginning of May.', 'I believe that this would have seriously interfered in the electoral process taking place in Israel. I hope that a democratic government like the one country has had until now will emerge as a result of this process so that the negotiations will continue and arrive at a positive outcome for this peace process.', 'I am convinced that the decision by the Berlin European Council on this matter was very positive and that it will help maintain the European Union\"s influence in this area. But elections will also need to be held in Palestine in the very near future. The European Union itself was present at the 1996 elections and soon a period of four years will have elapsed since then. Only once elections have taken place will we be able to genuinely talk about real dialogue between democratic states.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, the European Commission also believes that the Palestinian leaders have taken the right decision in the interests of the Palestinian people by postponing the 4 May date for proclaiming a state. Better still, the Commission believes that this positive move was possible in part due to the courage displayed by the European Council in adopting the so‐called Berlin Declaration on the Middle East. Our common foreign and security policy has worked properly in this instance as this declaration was important in guaranteeing the peaceful and constructive continuation of the peace process in spite of the fact that the first transitional period established by the Oslo Agreements had come to an end.', 'As you know, the Commission already called for an increased political and economic role for the Union in the Middle East in its communication of January 1998. Nonetheless, it is clear that the tacit extension of the transitional period does not provide a long‐term solution. In this respect, the European Union has expressed its belief that the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state that is democratic, viable and peaceful, created on the basis of the existing agreements and through negotiation would be the best guarantee of security for Israel and the best guarantee of success in the region. The European Union has stated that, in due course, it is prepared to recognise a Palestinian state established in this way.', 'In the short term – as is also stated in the Berlin declaration – the European Union is still concerned about the stalemate in the peace process and, in this respect, it is vital that after the elections in Israel, the parties urgently turn their attention to fully applying the respective commitments made in the Wye Plantation memorandum. This would allow accelerated negotiations on issues relating to the region\"s permanent status to begin at the same time, with a view to concluding these negotiations within the set period of one year.', 'Assuming that the parties involved show the political will needed to make progress, the European Union will continue to help them by facilitating the resolution of all outstanding matters. We must take all steps to ensure that the Wye Plantation Agreement does not become another Israeli or Palestinian agreement that is not applied.', 'In this context, there should be no attempts to introduce new conditions. What is more, we agree with the United States that the Palestinian authorities have fulfilled, and are continuing to fulfil, the majority of their commitments. Consequently, we are keenly awaiting the next stages of withdrawals from the West Bank as well as the release of many prisoners. In addition, we still recommend that Israel should be flexible over fundamental issues such as safety on the roads between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the development, opening and completion of the port of Gaza itself, as these are issues that have been postponed for a long time. In this respect, the Commission is still working closely with Mr Moratinos, the European Union\"s special envoy responsible for common dialogue.', 'We believe that the revitalisation of the Israeli‐Palestinian aspect of the peace process would also facilitate the long awaited resumption of multilateral negotiations. And although the European Union is aware that this is extremely difficult, it will continue to try to revitalise and initiate cooperation. This means that we would also be very interested to see the Syrian and Lebanese parties becoming involved in the peace process.', 'As regards the question by Mr Bertens and Mrs van Bladel concerning the hospital, the Gaza hospital is an UNRWA hospital. It is not a European Commission hospital nor is was it built by the European Commission; it is an UNRWA hospital. Nonetheless, in the guerrilla warfare of recent months, all the bad things taking place in the world are being blamed on the European Commission. The hospital was built by the UNRWA and it has received a contribution from the Community budget.', 'Furthermore, there are other contributions from the Danish, German, Austrian, Spanish, Swedish and Belgian national budgets. So what happened? There was a twelve‐month delay in opening the hospital. The problem is now resolved, and as I sure you are informed about what you ask of the Commission, you must remember that we decided not to pay any more running costs. The European Commission must do what it can do well. The European Commission is not a hospital agent and it cannot run a large hospital thousands of kilometres away. Consequently, technical assistance has been given to the Palestinian Authority in the form of an international team that is going to work with the Palestinian authorities for two years. The aim of this is to ensure that the Palestinian Authority takes responsibility for managing the hospital. Fortunately, this issue has now been resolved.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Marín.', 'The joint debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.', 'President . – The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:', '‐ B4‐0461/99 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0473/99 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance', '‐ B4‐0475/99 by Mr Manisco, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left', '‐ B4‐0480/99 by Mr Cars, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party', \"‐ B4‐0496/99 by Mrs Lenz, Mr Soulier and Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party\", '‐ B4‐0502/99 by Mrs Aglietta and Mr Orlando, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the issue of the death penalty and a universal moratorium on capital punishment;', '‐ B4‐0465/99 by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0481/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party', '‐ B4‐0490/99 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left', '‐ B4‐0493/99 by Mr Pasty and Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group', '‐ B4‐0509/99 by Mrs Aelvoet, Mr Tamino and Mr Ceyhun, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the trial of Mr Öcalan and the future of the Kurdish question in Turkey;', '‐ B4‐0462/99 by Mr Harrison and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0491/99 by Mr Pasty and Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group', '‐ B4‐0506/99 by Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the political misuse of trials in politics in Malaysia;', '‐ B4‐0463/99 by Mrs Berès and Mr Vecchi, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0468/99 by Mr Pradier and Mr Hory, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance', '‐ B4‐0477/99 by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left', '‐ B4‐0482/99 by Mr Fassa, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party', \"‐ B4‐0497/99 by Mr Lehideux, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party\", '‐ B4‐0504/99 by Mr Telkämper and Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the human rights situation in Djibouti;', '‐ B4‐0466/99 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0469/99 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance', '‐ B4‐0476/99 by Mrs Sierra González, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left', '‐ B4‐0483/99 by Mr Cars, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party', '‐ B4‐0492/99 by Mr Pasty and Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group', \"‐ B4‐0498/99 by Mr Oostlander and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party\", '‐ B4‐0501/99 by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.', 'Death penalty', 'Imbeni (PSE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, a few days ago I received a letter from a committee set up in support of a campaign to save the life of Greg Sommer, one of so many people condemned to death and awaiting execution. Of course I, like many of my colleagues too, I imagine, would respond positively in this case, as in the cases of other people condemned to death in China, Iran and in many other countries as well as the United States. But we feel the time has now come to do something out of the ordinary: we would like to use this famous year 2000 – a year of great symbolic value for all the countries of the world, not just those with a particular tradition, history or religion – to make an exceptional gesture.', 'If the year 2000 does have great symbolic value, let us seriously and genuinely use it to send out this universal message: let us have a moratorium on all cases where a death sentence has already been handed down, in other words let us suspend capital punishment.', 'This is the request we are making in this resolution, which I think will meet with the approval of all the groups in Parliament. Our group fully supports it in any case. We therefore want to send a clear message to the Cologne Council: the German Presidency should ask for this issue to be put on the agenda for the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly and the Finnish Presidency should be given the task of following this decision through so that, by August, this item is on the United Nations\" agenda and can actually be discussed at the next General Assembly. If this decision on a moratorium were actually to be taken at the next United Nations General Assembly, I think we would have sent out a positive message to all the countries of the world and we would also have raised a problem in those countries which refuse to tackle this subject in a decisive way.', 'The death penalty is not justice but vengeance! This needs to be realised once and for all in all the countries of the world.', 'Dupuis (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that our colleague Mr Imbeni has summarised the aim of this resolution very well. It should be pointed out that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights approved three such resolutions in succession: in 1997, 1998 and 1999.', 'As Mr Imbeni has just said, the time has come to use the year 2000 to take that qualitative leap and to present a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly for a universal moratorium. There is a majority of 101 countries, out of the total of 190 in the international community, who are in favour of a universal moratorium, and the Treaties that have been adopted and the constitutional changes that have been made by many countries show that it is not simply a theoretical majority.', 'The conditions are therefore in place for launching an offensive that will undoubtedly not be the final step, but which could be a decisive move towards the definitive abolition of the death penalty in the world. I urge the Council and the Commission to work towards this.', 'Allow me to point out an error – which is of a formal rather than a political nature – in the text of the resolution. I apologise for this and I will table an oral amendment to delete from recital E the words ‘unlike the resolutions already adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, \" because this is not strictly correct. If my colleagues have no objection, I will table an oral amendment shortly, when it is put to the vote.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR IMBENI\\nVice‐President', 'Cars (ELDR). – (SV) Mr President, I see it as a great feat of civilisation that the European continent is now virtually rid of capital punishment. Such an advance would not have been possible without the unequivocal stance adopted by the European Union, and the world should be aware of that. This is a message that Europe can be proud to proclaim.', 'There are positive developments outside Europe too, particularly in Latin America. In countries where democracy does not exist, however – in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq – the death penalty is often applied. Yet we still have one large democracy where ever more people are being executed, ever more people put to death. This is a serious issue in itself, and it brings with it certain consequences. China and the other countries I mentioned can say that ‘as long as America continues to execute its citizens, why should we care what Europe thinks?\"', 'Europeans shy away from criticising America. We have our good reasons; yet capital punishment must be combated. Let us make our voice heard; let us defend our position more forcefully and powerfully. Not in a spirit of moral superiority – that is not what I mean at all – but because we worry and care as fellow human beings.', \"Lenz (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, on this Thursday, during this afternoon's topical and urgent debate, many of us here will obviously be delivering our final speeches on the subject of human rights. We have been making these speeches for 20 years, and our cooperation has been fruitful. It is perhaps slightly gratifying, if I may endorse what my colleagues have said, that we have seen some more progress on this very issue of the death penalty. It may be that we have played some part in ensuring that a third call is now being made in Geneva for a worldwide moratorium on executions.\", \"It is the sincere wish of our group, and of others too, that the Council should sponsor a motion to that effect at the General Assembly of the United Nations. That may be the only way to make those countries that Mr Cars has just mentioned realise that the death penalty is truly the worst means of restoring people's human dignity, for every person should have the opportunity to atone for the wrong that he or she has done. With the death penalty, that opportunity is irretrievably lost – quite apart from the fact that the death penalty is flagrantly abused in some cases.\", 'If we in the European Parliament have helped to broaden awareness of that, not only through Mr Dupuis reminding us to include the death penalty on every agenda but also simply by highlighting a number of facts time and again in the name of our Parliament, then perhaps we have contributed in some small way to the protection of human rights.', 'In conclusion, Mr President, let me say that I fervently wish – and you will see whether this happens – that the next Parliament will continue this discussion, that it will not allow human rights to be squeezed out by economic issues, by the issues relating to enlargement, important though they may be, but that it will regard human rights as a political priority that must be pursued through the policies of the European Union, through its foreign policy and its enlargement policy. Abolition of the death penalty is part of that priority. There are many others, and I sincerely hope that they will all receive due consideration.', '(Applaus)', 'President . ‐ Thank you very much, Mrs Lenz, for that statement. I would also like to thank you on behalf of our colleagues for the commitment and competence with which you have chaired the Subcommittee on Human Rights in the past and have continued to make a major contribution to it. I genuinely believe that your experience will be of use to us in all our future work. Thank you, Mrs Lenz.', 'Holm (V). – (SV) Mr President, our goal evidently has to be abolition of the death penalty. No nation in the world should employ capital punishment. We all need to castigate the USA, China and many other countries which so blatantly violate human dignity by persisting in allowing the death penalty to be imposed. Many of the EU Member States have an important role to play here. We have all been pioneers in fighting for the abolition of capital punishment. It would certainly be a step in the right direction if a universal moratorium, heralding an end to this practice, were to be proclaimed', 'I call upon the Council to make provision for this issue to be taken up during the next session of the United Nations General Assembly. Action will be required from both the German and the Finnish Presidencies to ensure that this actually happens, and that we can say goodbye once and for all to capital punishment.', 'Pailler (GUE/NGL). – (FR) Mr President, I am delighted to make this last speech while you are presiding, and on this subject, as you have also helped us a great deal. We must be conscious of the great deal of work that remains to be done in order to civilise mankind, given that in 1999 we are still asking for a universal moratorium on capital punishment.', 'I would like to discuss America, that vast country that claims to be the policeman of the world and the model of democracy, freedom and modernity. On 21 April, a fortnight ago, I became the first Member of the European Parliament to ever enter death row, in order to meet Mumia Abu Jamal, a political prisoner who has been sentenced to death, and on whose behalf Parliament has passed many resolutions. Something of me stayed in that prison in Greene, where 111 prisoners out of 600 were awaiting execution.', 'Parts of me stayed in prison. It is not an image, it is a very physical experience. It hurts. I find the idea of his execution unbearable, as I do the execution of thousands who are sentenced to death, some of whom I saw behind Mumia Abu Jamal, wearing their white and blue prison clothes.', 'Mumia Abu Jamal talked to me first of all about the tragedy in Denver, which had happened the day before, about Kosovo, and about the culture of death that is consuming American society. So today I would like to put a question to America. Your children are now killing your children. Are you going to educate them by putting them in the electric chair? No. This violence is in fact the response to your state violence, which takes the form of the death penalty, but also the racist justice and class justice which Mumia condemned.', 'In order to convince the Council and all of my colleagues to never give up on this issue, allow me to tell you a short anecdote. In the morning, before I arrived at the prison and death row, I gave a press conference. A journalist stood up and said to me that it had just been announced that three names had been given for the death warrants for May. He asked me if I took that as a response to what I was doing at the time in America.', 'My first reaction was to shed tears, then I recovered myself, but it was unbearable to think about that. The reason I am telling you this today is to tell you that although the tears may not return, that emotion will stay with me until we have succeeded in obtaining this moratorium, in abandoning the ways of the past, the barbarity, and moving forward on the path of the future and of civilisation.', 'I will finish this last speech, this last cry from the voice of those who have no voice, with the rallying cry of the black people, who are campaigning in large numbers against the death penalty in the United States, along with whites, Indians, Amerindians and Latinos, saying ‘On the move!\"', 'Kurdish question', 'Swoboda (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are speaking in this House about Turkey, and once again we do so with mixed feelings, because there are bad signs and there are a few good signs, and we are not sure of the direction in which Turkey is heading. First of all, the Öcalan case has come before the courts. We do not really have the impression that this is a fair, open and transparent trial. We have a feeling of unease, stemming from the fact that the death penalty is once again being made popular and respectable in Turkey, notably through the Öcalan trial. Secondly, we are deeply concerned that an extremely nationalistic party experienced a very strong upsurge in support at the last elections and that its manifesto does not call for conciliation with the Kurdish population, but rather the opposite.', 'Thirdly, the HADEP party did well in the elections, especially in the Kurdish area, and there are now 41 HADEP members in charge of local administrations. We doubt whether these 41 mayors will be allowed to exercise their democratic rights as elected representatives of the people. There are already numerous indications that the government would really prefer to deprive the mayors of that right. We know that many, many dozens and indeed hundreds of people are still locked up in prisons, some of them officials of that selfsame party, without due process, without trial, without conviction. What about them? When will they finally be released? When will they stand trial before a court of law? Why do the authorities hesitate to institute proceedings against these people? There is probably no real evidence against them.', 'Fourthly, there is Akin Birdal, whom I was able to visit in Ankara a few days after the attempt on his life and whom all, or at least many of us know as a staunch campaigner for human rights. He seems to have recovered enough to be put in prison, and he is to be taken into custody in the next few days. We know, however, that the care and treatment and the therapy he needs if he is really to be restored to full health will scarcely be possible in a Turkish prison. A serious question mark hangs over this case.', 'Fifthly, perhaps the most encouraging feature of the whole situation is that there is a President of the Constitutional Court who said clearly and plainly only a few days ago that many legal provisions in Turkey would have to be amended because they were contrary to human rights, because they were incompatible with the rights that should exist in a democratic state. I hope that this school of thought can gradually gain the upper hand. It is a hard struggle, and I hope, Commissioner, Mr Vice‐President, that you will speak out clearly on behalf of the Commission and the European Union in order to help that school of thought to prevail, because at the moment Turkey is turning away from Europe rather than moving in our direction. If we in this House and in this European Union do something to help the Kurds, we shall actually be doing something for Turkey and helping to bring it closer to the rest of Europe.', 'Bertens (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, on 24 February we held a debate in Brussels following the arrest of Mr Öcalan, and I criticised the PKK terrorist organisation and Mr Öcalan himself. We have never tried to put a positive spin on his activities or his aims, and we only hope that the Turkish Government will ensure that his trial is open and fair, although we do not feel exactly optimistic about this. His lawyers have scarcely been given access to him, the national security court hardly seems the most appropriate place to be holding the trial, and no international observers are to be admitted. I hope that the new government in Turkey realises that if it wants to be rid of the Kurdish problem, Öcalan must certainly be given a fair trial.', 'Mr President, this is a day – indeed a whole week – of goodbyes, but unfortunately we cannot say goodbye to the problems and issues that we have discussed in the topical and urgent debates. I also hope that we will not be saying goodbye to the debates themselves, because in the ten years I have been in Parliament I have heard it said almost every month that this would be the last time we would be having such a debate. I can tell you that I have done my calculations and I reckon that I have spoken some 428 times in the topical and urgent debates. I do not know whether it has ever achieved anything, but my successors – and your successor and the Commissioner\"s successor – should all bear in mind that this is the only channel the European Parliament has to show that we also care about people outside this House and outside Europe, and that we care about other things than just our salaries and pensions. Thank you and goodbye. That is all I wished to say.', '(Applaus)', 'President . ‐ Mr Bertens, you are normally very calm and composed when you take the floor, even when commenting on the most sensitive of matters. I feel I share your state of mind and can understand the reasons why you raised your voice a little in making a demand which I am sure is endorsed by all colleagues, or at least those who are present in the Chamber at the moment.', 'Papayannakis (GUE/NGL). ‐ (EL) Mr President, Mr Öcalan will not have the open and fair trial we call for in our resolutions. I have here the press release of the public prosecutor\"s office of the Ankara State Security Court, signed by the public prosecutor, Tjerdet Volkan, which rules out the participation in the trial of ‘observers from any institution or organisation whatsoever\". It provides for the participation of the general public, insofar as the capacity of the court room allows, with the authorisation of the special office of the Court and then not for all the days of the trial.', 'Of course, Mr President, Turkey has not been put under any serious pressure – and I do not mean the outrageous bombing that others are suffering – to comply with the standards of a modern European rule of law, for reasons which the Council, so sensitive and so rigorous in other circumstances, has not managed to explain!', 'This weakness does not simply concern Mr Öcalan, but the more important issue of the human rights of all Turks and, more especially, the large Kurdish minority in Turkey, whose identity, language, education and political expression is not recognised. The HADEP Party is savagely persecuted, Leyla Zana, the recipient of the European Parliament\"s Sakharov Prize for the defence of human rights is in prison, and we do nothing.', 'Could the Council, as it does in other circumstances, perhaps express its condemnation of this suppression of the political and cultural rights of the Kurds? How does the Council – and, what is more, the Commission – plan to exert its influence to reform and improve the regime that is being enforced against the Kurds?', 'The bottom line is that Turkey and its people, of whatever national and linguistic origin, belong to the European horizon, and the ‘humanitarian\" and ‘liberal\" declarations which most governments in the European Union – also members of NATO – allegedly want to implement within a wider Europe relate to them.', 'Is there anyone in the Council or the Commission who has something convincing to say on these matters, Mr President?', 'van Bladel (UPE). – (NL) Mr President, this morning Mr Öcalan\"s lawyers told the House that they are totally unable to work and that they have even come under threat. Parliament is right to continue to call for Mr Öcalan to be given a fair trial. But we must not forget that we have pushed this man from one country to another because we ourselves were unable to try him – and there was a warrant out for his arrest – under our own legal systems.', 'In addition to this, however, if we look at the situation since we concluded the Customs Union with Turkey, it has actually turned its back on us, and the recent elections showed that it is turning inwards and becoming increasingly nationalistic, and with the events nearby in the Balkans there will be little scope for the fundamental aspirations and rights of the Kurds. Or perhaps there will be. Perhaps there is a sensible man in Ankara who thinks the time to negotiate with the Kurds and to forge a new relationship with them is now or never. But this would require an international confidence‐building plan with a fixed timetable, and there is still no mention of that. I hope there is a politician or perhaps a former Commissioner somewhere who could draw up such a plan so that, having left office, he can help to bring the Turks and the Kurds closer together. But it would have to be a plan with a fixed timetable that can restore confidence, because having to receive Kurds every day in your office is no joke, believe me. I am perfectly happy to do it, but it is not helping them.', 'Ceyhun (V). – (DE) Mr President, this is not only about Mr Öcalan or about whether or not he is to be put on trial. I come from Germany, and in my country Mr Öcalan would have received a trial. This is about the fact that we rightly expect Turkey to ensure in the next few days or months that the procedure and outcome of this trial are in accordance with the rule of law. That is what Europe legitimately expects of Turkey, a country with a great interest in becoming a member of the European Union.', 'If Turkey really does want to become a member of the European Union, it must show us how the rule of law applies to the treatment of a defendant in its trials. That is the substance of this motion which we are discussing today and which we shall probably adopt tomorrow. This expectation of ours must not be misinterpreted in Turkey. The Turkish judicial authorities and the other Turkish authorities involved in this trial ultimately have a very important task. If they genuinely want to bring about a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish problem, they must now treat Mr Öcalan properly as a defendant. There can be no talk of his being guilty before the prosecution has proved its case in court. He must be treated fairly at all costs, and his lawyers must not suffer harassment because they are representing him.', 'If Turkey maintains it is a European country, a country fit for the European Union, these European values, these Western standards, must be applied there. We want no more than that, which is why we ask Turkey not to misunderstand these efforts that the European Parliament is making.', 'Malaysia', 'Holm (V). – (SV) Mr President, the justice system in Malaysia is clearly rotten to the core. No self‐respecting democracy would allow the flagrant infringements of human rights that are occurring there. Malaysia claims to be democratic; yet it arrests and imprisons individuals who seek peacefully to express political or religious views, denying them due legal process. This is no way to behave.', 'It is incumbent upon us to take these matters up with the Malaysian authorities and make them understand. The treatment of homosexuals in the country is another issue which needs to be raised. It is disgraceful – and a crime against fundamental human rights – that people can be sentenced to up to 20 years in gaol for having engaged in homosexual relations. Provided two individuals have consented to have such contact, there are no grounds for condemning them. We must continue to argue along these lines in order to ensure that homosexuals are not treated in such a way.', 'Against this background, it is a pity that we did not demonstrate greater understanding of homosexuality by showing the renowned exhibition entitled Ecce homo in Parliament\"s premises.', 'Ford (PSE). – Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in support of the joint resolution on the political misuse of trials in Malaysia, I have to say to the Malaysian authorities that it is very difficult for any of us to have any sympathy with their recent actions.', 'Firstly they continue to maintain their internal security act which, against any normal conception of human rights, allows those peacefully expressing both religious and political opinions at odds with those of the government to be arrested, denied proper legal representation or even a fair trial.', \"Secondly, they have a penal code which – as Mr Holm said earlier – condemns homosexual acts between consenting adults with a punishment of whipping and up to 20 years' imprisonment.\", 'Thirdly, all the evidence is that the trials of both Anwar Ibrahim and Lim Guan Eng were politically motivated. We know that Anwar Ibrahim was physically abused prior to his trial. He received six years in jail for corruption, following what most outside observers considered to be farcical proceedings which were a travesty of any notion of justice. And yet they continue to pursue him with threats of yet more trials.', 'In conclusion, we have to urge the Malaysian authorities to recognise that the development of further political and economic cooperation between the European Union and Malaysia will largely depend on the opening of a serious dialogue that will lead to moves in Malaysia for the observation of basic human rights in that country.', 'Djibouti', 'Vecchi (PSE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, as in December 1997, unfortunately we are again having to turn our attention to human rights violations in Djibouti and in particular to the situation of political prisoners, who are not only subjected to unlawful imprisonment, which is unacceptable in our eyes, but also to every kind of ill‐treatment, which in some cases has caused the deaths of some of them. Unfortunately this is just one aspect of the ethnic and political oppression which has deprived most of this country\"s people of their basic rights. Through our resolution we therefore intend to call upon the authorities of Djibouti, and first and foremost President Guelleh, to rectify this unacceptable situation.', 'I would point out that the Horn of Africa is devastated by conflicts of every type; it is up to the Djibouti authorities to decide whether to let their country plunge into violence, instability and lawlessness or, on the other hand, to rebuild the conditions necessary for coexistence on new foundations.', 'We feel that this partly depends on the revival of a peace and stability process for the entire region. Therefore we urge that there should be a stop to all ill‐treatment of political prisoners, and that they should be given access to any care and treatment required, allowed a fair trial and be released. Respect for human rights must also be restored and guaranteed for all and, above all, any discrimination based on ethnic origin must cease.', 'The government of Djibouti also undertook to respect this principle when it signed up to the Lomé Convention, Article 5 of which states that each signatory shall be guided by the principles of respect for human rights and democratisation of their own country. I think Article 5 should be borne in mind because if, first and foremost, the specific situation of political prisoners and, more generally, the human rights situation are not improved, the application of this article and the measures which derive from it is an option worth considering.', 'President . – Thank you for those words, Mr Vecchi, and for the commitment which you have shown to the problems of the ACP countries and also demonstrated in the committee which has been responsible for all aspects of cooperation and development.', 'Maes (ARE). – (NL) Mr President, ten years ago Parliament was discussing human rights violations in Kosovo and now there is a war there. Today we are talking about Djibouti and other countries, and I am firmly convinced that if we take the right measures now we can help these countries to develop peacefully and to avoid war.', 'A new president has been elected in Djibouti, so this is a good time to point out that there must be an end to the human rights violations and the inhuman treatment of political prisoners, who are left languishing in prison untended and without rights. We are not trying to deny that there is armed opposition in Djibouti, but even unarmed political opponents are thrown into prison anyway, and that is unacceptable.', 'Djibouti is one of the countries covered by the Lomé Convention, and we should regard this as a contract between us and point this out to the other countries involved. We should make it clear to them that we cannot provide any financial assistance whatsoever if they spend it on arms which they then use to wage war and even to oppress their own people, particularly the Afar tribe.', 'We know the enormous suffering that war brings, and just because Djibouti is a little further away we must not forget this, otherwise it will be too late there as well.', 'Fassa (ELDR). ‐ (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several colleagues who have taken the floor before me have mentioned Article 5 of the Lomé Convention, to which Djibouti is also a signatory, which establishes a genuine interrelation and operational interplay between respect for and enjoyment of political and civil rights and fundamental human freedoms and development aid.', 'I think we should press this point very strongly. We cannot be satisfied with the answer that a country\"s straitened economic circumstances are an obstacle to the establishment of a fully‐fledged democracy. I think it would be more true to say precisely the opposite! Indeed in the developing countries, those which have signed the Lomé Convention, we see many good examples of countries which have got under way with economic development as a consequence of the re‐establishment of democratic rules, and for precisely this reason we should put more pressure on Djibouti to comply with this genuine contractual agreement it has entered into with its European partners.', 'Lehideux (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, it is sometimes difficult to find different or new words to say what we think of the violations of human rights that we discuss during every sitting in this House.', 'We agree with everything that has been said by the previous speakers from all groups. As Mrs Maes said, I think that we should indeed take advantage of the recent election of the new President, Mr Guelleh, in order to define the Union\"s position very clearly and firmly and to indicate that we will see to it that the famous Article 5 is applied very soon.', 'The arrest of a number of leaders of the opposition outside the borders of Djibouti, notably in Ethiopia and Yemen, their extradition to Djibouti and their imprisonment, the conditions in which they are being detained, the absence of a trial and of lawyers, the particularly difficult and distressing conditions of their imprisonment: we are aware of all these things and it is clear that we cannot allow this to happen. The Djibouti authorities must know that we are going to act swiftly and that we are going to make use of the texts to which their country is a signatory.', 'Mr President, I think that if we delay we are in danger of being faced with an even more distressing and even more difficult situation in a few months\" time, if that is possible given the fate of those whom we are discussing.', 'Therefore, on behalf of my group, I call upon the Commission and the Council to take firm and immediate action as quickly as possible, so that our intentions will be made known without delay.', 'International Criminal Court', 'Barros Moura (PSE). – (PT) Mr President, I think we would all recognise that the Rome Conference on 18 July 1998 on the Statute of the permanent International Criminal Court represented a step forward in terms of international institutions and in the international legal order concerning human rights. Nevertheless, before this Court can actually become effective in practice, its Statute has to be ratified by at least 60 countries. And up to now, with the honourable exceptions of Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago and San Marino, no other country in the international community has ratified it yet, although some have started the ratification process.', 'So the objective of the resolution we have submitted is to get the Statute ratified by at least 60 countries by the end of the year 2000, so that the International Criminal Court can start to function in that year. The resolution further calls upon the Council to include this objective on the agenda of the European Council in Cologne. Now, I believe that at a time when we are discussing the right to humanitarian intervention, and at a time when it is recognised that the international community requires instruments enabling it to defend fundamental human rights where they are being violated in a serious and flagrant manner, it is clearly perverse that there should be delays in creating what might be viewed as a legal forum governing the right of intervention, which is precisely what this would be. It is equally paradoxical that it should be precisely a number of those countries that are practising so‐called ‘humanitarian intervention\" which have the most reservations about approving the Statute of the International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that this Statute contains an unacceptable exclusion clause. That is why I believe that it is important for us to appeal to those countries, and above all our Member States and the larger countries, to ratify the Statute and to specifically reject the exclusion clause on war crimes, so as to create a genuine legal body with compulsory jurisdiction, through which we can legitimise the right of intervention.', 'Sierra González (GUE/NGL). – (ES) Mr President, the current difficulties in punishing those who have committed crimes such as genocide, war crimes and, in general, crimes against humanity have more than demonstrated the need to establish an International Criminal Court. It must be operational as soon as possible and be able to effectively try those responsible for such crimes so that they do not go unpunished.', 'In this context, it is disappointing that no Member State of the European Union has ratified the Statute for this Court. This is all the more disappointing when we take account of the fact that the Union claims to be not only an area of pluralism and diversity but, in particular, a Community of law. The ratification of the Statute of the Court, with no exclusions in terms of its remit, would demonstrate our commitment to complying with the law and to defending freedoms and human life. These objectives of the Union are at least as important as our commercial objectives.', 'For this reason, I am calling on the Council and the Commission today to establish the ratification of the Statute of the Criminal Court as a political objective for the Union. When we talk about the right to intervene, this House believes that the right to intervene is valid when it refers to military situations but not when it refers to other matters.', 'Cars (ELDR). – (SV) Mr President, the purpose of this resolution is to underline the importance attached by Parliament to speedy ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. We want to see the court operational as soon as possible. Nothing that has occurred in Kosovo or anywhere else has diminished the significance of this. The Liberal Group unanimously endorses the call for such a court to be set up.', 'This week – in the course of my three final speeches in the European Parliament – it has given me great satisfaction to be able to speak out in favour of peace and freedom in Kosovo, to support the EU\"s fight for the abolition of the death penalty, and to argue for an international tribunal to judge war crimes. These three issues reflect some of the basic values underpinning our Union: freedom for the oppressed, the rule of law, democracy and common humanity.', 'As a student from a country which did not take part in the Second World War, I was horrified by what that conflict produced. For me too, European integration came to figure as the key to overcoming hatred and building a new and better order for a healed and whole Europe. I have met many people in this Parliament who feel the same way and have as a result become my friends.', 'Much more than I could ever even have dreamed of as a young man has come about, but a great deal still remains to be achieved. I like to believe that there will always be people with dreams and expectations of a better Europe and a better world – people with the strength and determination to make their dreams a reality.', \"Habsburg‐Lothringen (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, I believe it is really very significant that this Parliament, which has concerned itself so much with human rights issues, should conclude its topical and urgent debates on human rights for this term by turning its attention once again to the question of the International Criminal Court. I think that Parliament has done a great deal of work in that direction through its intergroup, which bears the significant name ‘No peace without justice'. I believe one thing must be clear to us here, namely that this intergroup which deals with the subject of the International Criminal Court, and of which my colleague Mr Dell'Alba is one of the leaders, is saying quite plainly that there must be justice with a legal basis. Sad to say, we usually have a legal basis for various operations, as we are witnessing in Kosovo at the present time; we have it at international level through the United Nations or through an organisation such as NATO, we have it at national level and at regional level, where such legal provisions can be effectively enforced.\", 'One area in which we are regrettably without such a legal basis is that of ethnic groups and minorities. I believe that is the reason why many conflicts of the past ten to fifteen years have been pursued by force of arms rather than before a tribunal or a criminal court. I therefore consider it especially important that we in the European Union should act with the utmost vigour and tell our Member States that they should be among the first to ratify the Statute of this International Criminal Court and that they should press for the establishment of the Court and not leave it to other states, such as San Marino and Senegal, which have devoted themselves to this cause with admirable zeal. We should set an example here. The European Parliament, with its tradition of commitment to human rights, certainly possesses excellent credentials in this area.', 'Holm (V). – (SV) Mr President, we now need this International Criminal Court more urgently than ever before. The turn taken by events in recent years has borne out what we have been repeating all along in this House.', 'What is needed is an international forum in which – before there is recourse to military means – issues can be managed and resolved in a dignified way. It was a major step forward when the Statute was adopted last July, but I deplore the fact that not one of the EU\"s Member States has yet ratified it. The procedures ought to have been set in train much more swiftly. I am pleased to see that as many as 82 countries have in fact signed the Statute, but it is regrettable that only three have ratified.', 'Let us all go back home to our Member States and ensure that our governments sign and ratify this Statute as soon as possible. We owe this service to the next millennium.', 'Dell\"Alba (ARE). – (IT) Mr President, I am particularly glad that the last time I take the floor during this parliamentary term should be to speak on the subject of the International Criminal Court. I would like to thank Karl Habsburg very much indeed for mentioning the role of the intergroup we set up with so many colleagues. The ‘No peace without justice\" campaign by the international radical movement has helped to promote what I feel amounts to one of the most important messages we can pass on at the end of a century which has been the bloodiest in history. Just three countries have already ratified the Statute of the Court but others are about to do so. Our country, Mr President, will probably do so at the end of May, and France is well on the way. A strong signal needs to come from Cologne so that the fifteen Member States, whose role was decisive for the success of the Rome Conference, should set the tone for the other countries and be the first to ratify the Statute.', 'It is not by chance that the very first countries to do so were an African country, a Caribbean country and San Marino. Europe is lagging behind somewhat: it should pass on this message! I hope that Parliament will state this clearly afterwards.', 'Rübig (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk today about justice and security, we can begin with an example close to home. A few weeks ago in front of the Parliament building in Brussels, a woman was murdered. The important thing is that the culprit should be quickly arrested, brought to trial and fairly sentenced. It is exactly the same with international human rights. We cannot simply tolerate and accept the violation of human rights. What we need is a system whereby offenders are extradited and made to face the consequences of their actions. Justice and security, after all, are among the main pillars on which our European Union is built, and not only our European Union but also the applicant countries and the rest of the world. We must campaign to ensure that our 15 Member States recognise the International Criminal Court and also that the rest of the world acknowledges these principles of justice and security.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, I should like to pass on the European Commission\"s reactions to the different points that have been raised in this urgent debate on human rights.', 'As regards the death penalty and the establishment of a universal moratorium on capital punishment, as you are all aware, on 28 April, the European Union did in fact take the initiative of submitting a draft resolution on the death penalty to the Commission on Human Rights.', 'This resolution was approved by 30 of the 53 member countries of this Commission and was sponsored by 72 states, seven more than in the previous session. In other words, awareness of this situation is being raised at international level. We must not give up hope as this type of battle, just like the battle you highlighted, and as is usually the case with all problems that affect human beings, is won on the basis of a persistent day‐to‐day fight.', 'Consequently, in relation to previous situations, there is no doubt that we are making progress. Of course, whether or not the United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution is in the hands of its members. If it were up to the Commission, we would have no trouble promoting it.', 'As regards the Kurdish issue and the Öcalan case, I would point out that, as you all know, the European Union adopted a declaration on the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan and the trial that is to take place in the near future. And, of course, the Commission fully supports the declaration made by the Union.', 'More specifically, the Commission stresses that the trial must be public, it must comply with the rule of law, it must take place before an independent court, Mr Öcalan must have access to a defence lawyer of his choice and international observers must be allowed to attend. The Commission is disappointed with the response from the Turkish Government stating that they will not admit international observers and it takes note of the fact that it has been assured that the trial will be a public one. We also deeply regret the request for the death penalty from the private prosecution. The Commission will pay close attention to the trial and the procedures followed.', 'As regards Malaysia, the Commission shares your view that the Malaysian Government must ensure that its legal system is not misused for political reasons. In line with this view, and given that Mr Anwar Ibrahim has already spent almost seven months in prison without bail being set, the Commission considers that the trial and the appeal the defence lawyers have already announced, must be concluded in accordance with the internationally accepted criteria on guaranteeing a fair trial.', 'The Commission also trusts that the necessary legal measures will be taken to determine who is responsible for the verbal and physical assaults on Mr Anwar Ibrahim. This also shows that the incident is linked to the current debate in Malaysia on the reform of the police.', 'The Commission is still concerned that if fundamental human rights continue to be restricted, such as the right to peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, this may give rise to a climate of instability and social unrest in Malaysia.', 'As for Djibouti, the Commission is aware that some political figures are being held in the Gabode prison and fully shares your concerns over the fate of these political prisoners. In all its contacts with the country\"s authorities, the Commission has reiterated its position on the respect for fundamental human freedoms and the rule of law. The Commission has also taken note of the recent proposals made by the Government of Djibouti which seek to allow the Red Cross or any other independent bodies to carry out inspection visits of the prisons. And, of course, we warmly welcome this position from the new government.', 'Contact has been made with the International Committee of the Red Cross and with the Member States so that they can begin helping displaced persons and refugees to return home, thus respecting their right to return to their place of origin.', 'As regards the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, I naturally believe that you have pointed out something that is mere common sense: the sooner this Court is up and running, the easier it will be to address and begin to resolve problems such as those in the Balkans – with Kosovo as the most recent example – as well as other problems throughout the world.', 'But of course we also believe, in particular, that our Member States should set an example and speed up the ratification procedures in the various national parliaments.', 'I should also like to draw to your attention to the fact that the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has been receiving financial support from the Community for several years. The Commission intends to continue to provide this support within the terms of the regulation adopted by the Council, which creates the legal basis that allows us to carry out and develop actions in the field of human rights.', 'President.- Thank You, Mr Marín.', 'The joint debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.', 'President . – The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:', '‐ B4‐0487/99 by Mr Pasty, Mr Andrews and Mr Girão Pereira, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group', \"‐ B4‐0507/99 by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party\", '‐ B4‐0508/99 by Mr Hory, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance', 'on the situation in the Comoros.', 'Lehideux (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, I would like to make a couple of comments on the joint motion for a resolution on the Comoros, which obviously begins by condemning the recent coup d\"état. I should say ‘the most recent\" coup d\"état, because goodness knows the Comoros have experienced a considerable number of them since gaining independence in 1975: this is the eighteenth one to be recorded!', 'Several comments have been made concerning the responsibility that could be attributed to those responsible for the secession of the island of Anjouan in the current crisis. To a certain extent the problem is like that of the chicken and the egg. In other words, the question is who first caused the problems. The fact that some of the problems in the Comoros have worsened and have been repeated is very probably because the existence of some populations with their own crises and their own problems, particularly on the island of Anjouan but also on the island of Mohéli, was not taken sufficiently into account.', 'Mr President, some people here – I know that Mr Hory is going to take the floor in a moment – know this area and the problems that it faces infinitely better than I do. What we can hope is that we are able to find a solution – and the Union must take part in this – that will be capable of stabilising relations between the three islands, if this is possible. In any case, this is what we want to see. This solution must also take account of the specific and particular needs of the people of each of these islands, needs which are specific even though the various populations are not very far from each other.', 'Personally, Mr President, I must say that I regret that recital G of this joint motion for a resolution casts some doubt on Parliament\"s opinion concerning the initiatives taken by the chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Mr Michel Rocard. Personally, I approved and supported them.', 'Hory (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, having observed the political collapse of the Comoros, we could well think that they are the victims of some sort of bad luck. In fact bad luck has nothing to do with it, and if we consider the situation objectively, we can clearly see three levels of responsibility.', 'Firstly – and even though it is not at all fashionable here to say such things – there is the responsibility of the Comoran people, or more precisely, of their leaders. In the 19th century the Comoros were called the islands of the battling sultans, because Grande Comore and Anjouan were dominated by a few supposedly noble families who had been fighting for power for centuries, and who forced the vast majority of the population to bear the weight of their privileges by enforcing vast social inequalities, unjustifiable financial monopolies and a truly medieval structure of society. This is the first level of responsibility.', 'In the current crisis – and this is not a fashionable thing to say either – the responsibility of the Organisation of African Unity must be underlined. It is theoretically in charge of reconciling the people of Grande Comore with those of Anjouan after the secession of the island of Anjouan.', 'The sole activity of the OAU, if not its sole raison d\"ętre , seems to be to defend the old colonial borders, against everything, against everyone, and even against obvious facts. The OAU is therefore very understandably accused of partiality, as it has shown itself to be indifferent to even the most legitimate claims made by Anjouan and Mohéli.', 'Finally, and I will not dwell very long on this point, there is the responsibility of France, which has been caricatured by the fact that the eighteenth coup d\"état in the Comoros coincides with the opening of the trial in Paris of the mercenary, Bob Denard, who in 1975, 1978, 1989 and 1995 was himself responsible for four coups d\"état in Moroni and who is suspected of murdering two Comoran heads of state. Today we have learnt that a former French Minister for Cooperation and Development will attend the trial to testify in his favour. I think that is all that need be said.', 'Having established these responsibilities, it seems that the European Union has a duty to make up for the inability of the usual key players on the Comoran stage by mounting a political initiative for inter‐island reconciliation, a considerable degree of humanitarian aid, particularly for Anjouan, and a fresh emergency economic aid programme for the Comoros.', 'Personally – and I will now conclude – I would like to stress this urgency from a particular point of view. As Mr Lehideux was kind enough to say, I am fortunate to have a last chance to speak in this House on a subject which concerns me personally. Since 1997, in Mayotte, which has fortunately remained French territory, there has been a massive and artificial influx of refugees as a result of the crisis in the Comoros that neither the public services, the local economy nor the people of Mayotte can withstand for much longer. The stabilisation of the Comoros is therefore the condition necessary for peace in the entire region.', 'Vecchi (PSE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, it is with some emotion that I am making my last speech in this Parliament.', 'The Islamic Republic of Comoros is a state which for many years now, virtually ever since independence, has been living through a serious institutional crisis, as previous speakers recalled. And it is the very unity of the country, or rather of the three islands making it up, that is constantly being called into question.', 'A few days ago a framework agreement was reached – helped on its way by the unobtrusive but extremely important work of President Michel Rocard, to whom we pay tribute – which did and still does provide a good basis on which to re‐establish conditions enabling coexistence between the various islands and the very survival of a state in the Comoros.', 'The military coup d\"état, which we of course condemn, followed in the wake of a number of serious incidents on Grande Comore against people from the island of Anjouan and was also due to the civil authorities\" inability to uphold the process of state reunification and reconciliation.', 'I believe that two things need to be done: the first is surely to re‐establish constitutional and civil order and put an end to the coup d\"état, which – as colleagues have pointed out – is the eighteenth one since the mid‐seventies; and secondly, and at the same time, the process of seeking a national agreement needs to continue and should also deal with those forces, not just military forces, wishing to maintain the supremacy of the people in one island over the others.', 'For that reason it is important that the representatives of the island of Anjouan be allowed to consult the people and to sign up to the agreement which all the others had endorsed before the coup. Furthermore, the international community, working inter alia through the Organisation of African Unity, but with the European Union playing an active role, should back this agreement and get to work preparing an economic assistance programme of both emergency and long‐term aid, to allow the country to recover in economic terms as well. This agreement would moreover, if it were successful, set a positive example for other African countries experiencing crises of a similar order and complexion.', 'Fassa (ELDR). ‐ (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as pointed out in the first paragraph of the preamble to the resolution and by Mr Lehideux, this is the eighteenth coup d\"état in the Comoros in the last twenty‐four years, making one every sixteen months. This statistic is sufficient to convey the difficult situation of a region which would otherwise have every likelihood of taking the right path towards democracy and development. We need only think of the example of Mauritius, which has many similar cultural and geopolitical characteristics.', 'Therefore, in my own humble opinion and in that of the group I represent, the European Union must deliver a clear, specific and united response from. Actions by individual politicians and countries are important, but only a collective effort on the part of the Union can bring something good out of this difficult and troubled time.', 'And having expressed this hope, Mr President, I would like to thank you in your capacity as President for the achievements of these last five years, and I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly those taking part in meetings on human rights and matters of urgency, for all the work they have done here and for all that I have learned from them.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, the European Commission shares the European Parliament\"s concerns over the situation in the Comoros following the coup d\"état which took place on 30 April 1999.', 'As you are well aware, the Commission reacted immediately and stressed the European Union\"s disapproval to the chief of staff, Colonel Azali Assoumani, drawing his attention to the principles on which our cooperation is based, the main elements of which are the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Furthermore, the European Commission has suggested to the Member States that they should apply the procedure set out in Article 366 of the Lomé Convention, which allows them to suspend cooperation with the Comoros.', 'In addition, the Commission is examining with the Member States the possibility of a diplomatic initiative aimed at applying the agreement signed in Madagascar on 29 April 1999 under the auspices of the OAU. Since 1998, the Commission has financed humanitarian aid programmes to the order of EUR 1 million to improve the situation of the people of Anjouan in terms of nutrition and health care, and the Commission has just approved a new programme to the value of EUR 730 000 which is aimed at providing primary health care. It is also examining whether or not it would be appropriate to approve an additional humanitarian aid programme in view of the requirements on the three islands as a result of the political instability.', 'The Commission\"s office in the Comoros is paying close attention to how the situation develops and, according to our latest information, the situation is calm and the army has established the initial contact needed to establish a transitional government in accordance with the agreement reached in Madagascar.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Marín.', 'Hory (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, I would like to make a point of order, to clarify, although everyone will have guessed it, that the former French Minister for Cooperation and Development, who is testifying in favour of the mercenary Bob Denard, is not Mr Jean‐Pierre Cot.', 'President . – Thank you for that clarification.', 'The joint debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.', 'President . – The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:', '‐ B4‐0457/99 by Mrs Stenzel and others', '‐ B4‐0458/99 by Mr Pompidou, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group', '‐ B4‐0464/99 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists', '‐ B4‐0484/99 by Mr Frischenschlager and Mr Eisma, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party', '‐ B4‐0489/99 by Mr Manisco and Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left', \"‐ B4‐0499/99 by Mr Chichester and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party\", '‐ B4‐0500/99 by Mr Weber and Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance', '‐ B4‐0505/99 by Mr Voggenhuber and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament', 'on the nuclear power plant in Temelin.', \"Flemming (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, in a few days' time, the Czech Government will make its decision on the completion of the nuclear power station in Temelin. Let me quote the report by the International Commission on Temelin, which said that there is currently an excess productive capacity and that power from the Temelin plant can only marginalise the use of other resources for power production. The stage has already been reached when any solution to the Temelin project will have more adverse than beneficial effects. Completion may bring even greater financial losses than discontinuing the construction work would cause. Economically, then, the situation is very tricky to downright crazy. And yet Western industries are still trying to make money there and have no compunction about possibly creating economic difficulties for a young democracy which, I hope, will very soon be a member of the European Union.\", \"The International Atomic Energy Agency formulates minimum technical safety standards for nuclear plants which even nuclear power stations in the third world could satisfy. That is well known. This assessment does not come from me, but from very high‐ranking diplomats and scientists. I consider that to be an insult to the Czech Government and an affront to the Czech people. In its conclusion of 7 December 1998 on nuclear safety, the Council, distancing itself from the IAEA, speaks of a ‘high level of nuclear safety'. That is quite a different matter!\", 'If I may quote the Temelin report again, it says that the release of radioactive substances will be prevented by a simple concrete shell in the event of a nuclear accident. How simple, I wonder! The report also states that the long‐term storage of radioactive waste will be assured in due course. So when and where will it be stored? Whatever the answers to these questions, I should like to thank all of my colleagues, particularly those from my own group, who intend to vote in favour of this resolution today.', 'Graenitz (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety has always been a very important subject in this House, since we are all aware that an accident in a nuclear power station affects not only the people who live and work nearby but also everyone else in Europe, and that we must therefore devote very special attention to safety.', 'As the previous speaker said, the government of the Czech Republic has been faced in these past few weeks with a decision as to whether or not the construction of the Temelin nuclear power station is to be completed. Ever since the borders between the Czech Republic and my own country were opened, this nuclear plant has been a source of endless amazement, since it was supposed to have been completed several years ago. Time and again they said the work would be done, but time and again it failed to materialise. I believe that all these points have to be considered very carefully; the fact that money has been spent on it already is no reason to finish building something that is neither safe nor economical.', 'However, I should like to highlight another point here. My group is not only anxious to voice our concerns about public safety in the European Union and in the Czech Republic and neighbouring countries; it also wishes to see aid being offered to promote change, to promote another form of energy production, another source of energy, a different type of energy efficiency to that which can be achieved with a nuclear power station, with the accompanying wastage of electrical energy.', \"What we are interested in is being able to offer ecologically as well as economically acceptable ways of obtaining sustainable energy to meet people's needs. Since this is my last speech in this House, allow me to mention that I myself have launched an initiative to that end. Under the scheme, known as ‘Building with the sun in Upper Austria and Southern Bohemia', mayors, administrators, engineers and architects are invited to work together on projects in which greater use is made of solar power, for the sun, after all, is a source of energy for all of us, and it is better to harness that energy than to construct our buildings in such a way that we need a great deal of nuclear power in order to heat them.\", 'Eisma (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, in most Central and Eastern European countries, nuclear power is routinely accepted as a way of meeting energy requirements. We know this, but we also know that we in western Europe tend to differentiate more. It is clear that the obsolete Russian nuclear plants need to be shut down, but the sort of plant we are discussing now, at Temelin, is a modern Russian power station, although it still needs to be brought up to international safety standards. I actually think that we need to consider which option is best for each country. Sometimes alternatives to nuclear power are possible, and if there is an option that is just as cost‐effective, then that is the one to go for. But if it appears that upgrading the obsolete plants is the only option, then the European Union must work with the applicant country, in this case the Czech Republic, to achieve this. Because there are question marks about the economic feasibility of Temelin, I do not think that we can take a decision yet, but we must work with the Czech Government to find the right solution. I hope that the Commission will concentrate its efforts on this over the next few months.', 'Mombaur (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, it is the sovereign right of every state, including the Czech Republic, to decide which primary sources of energy it uses. But the European Parliament must focus on the following point: all these matters have a bearing on the Community too and affect every one of us. In the case of power plants, this applies to safety standards, especially those governing the construction and operation of nuclear power stations, their fuel cycle and the disposal of their waste, and all of these things are important in the context of future accession treaties, because we cannot admit any new Member States which maintain lower safety standards than those which obtain in Western Europe by virtue of political decisions. Secondly, this is about the free energy market and future participants in that market. We shall naturally be unable to tolerate a situation in which customers can freely obtain electricity from producers who do not apply the common safety standards and thereby secure competitive advantages in an unacceptable way. These are the two Community aspects that we in Parliament must discuss. That is why it is right to adopt this resolution. That is why it is right that the Commission should deliver its opinion on the present reports too, because we have a duty to the European people to create transparency publicly here on this important issue. So it is certainly not a matter of the Czech Republic and Austria alone but rather about the European public, and we must remember that if we are to fulfil the mandate from our electorate.', 'Weber (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, I visited the Temelin power station that is under construction. I visited it as a national of a country that has four large nuclear power stations on its borders, notably the Cattenom station that is on French territory. French engineers have always tried to convince us that the French power stations were entirely safe with a high level of security. It has now been demonstrated that this is not the case. There is always a risk, one which the people of Luxembourg do not want.', 'I do not think that the Austrians, who are neighbours of the Czechs, should be exposed to the risks of a power station that is even more vulnerable to accidents. I think that the European Union should help the Czech Republic to equip itself with an alternative system for producing energy, that uses soft energy, but should not release funds for a Soviet‐designed type VVER 1000 power station which, in my opinion, presents a great many risks.', 'Voggenhuber (V). – (DE) Mr President, the most significant Austrian contribution to the common future of Europe in recent decades was the referendum in which the population rejected nuclear energy. What some of you dismissed at that time as the reaction of Luddites has long since proved to be a recognition of the insoluble nature of the problems of nuclear power, of the security issue, the waste disposal issue and the cost issue.', \"Over the past few years, the European Parliament has been increasingly supportive of the quest for new, sustainable forms of energy. It has recognised that the risks emanating from nuclear energy production in Central and Eastern Europe have assumed an entirely new dimension, but it has also recognised that the accession talks present us with a new opportunity. The Temelin nuclear power station is a yardstick of the credibility of this House. But the parliamentary groups remain split. The influence of the nuclear lobby in this House is still intolerably powerful. I wish we had received more decisive support in the past from some of those who have tabled this resolution today, particularly the European People's Party, and I wish that some of the signatories had been more effective advocates within their own party. Had that been the case, today's debate would not have exuded this faint odour of electioneering.\", 'Unfortunately, however, this Parliament of ours is still unable to act on its own judgement by making the abandonment of nuclear power in Europe one of its top priorities. But there is one responsibility that this House cannot evade today, namely its responsibility for enabling the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to switch to alternative energy policies, instead of helping them to pursue the dangerous and senseless upgrading and conversion of their nuclear plants.', 'Oostlander (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, along with many others, I am delighted about the forthcoming accession of the new Member States, and particularly the Czech Republic. At the same time, I think we need to adopt a sober and even strict approach when it comes to meeting the agreed political and economic criteria, since the successful operation of the enlarged Union is at stake here. However, this sensibly cautious approach must not mean that solutions to bilateral problems are forced on the applicant countries under the pressure of the accession process or by subtle references to it. The applicant countries are the weaker party in relations with the Union, and I do not think I need to remind anyone here that it is one of the most difficult tasks in politics to ensure that justice is done to the weaker party. As for the objections that Austria especially has against nuclear power stations in general and the one at Temelin in particular, I would point out that there are a number of recently built power stations in Central and Eastern Europe, many of which are considerably more dangerous than the one at Temelin. Furthermore, Temelin at least meets the internationally recognised minimum requirements, which definitely cannot be said of various other plants. This is why many in my group feel that it would not be right to single out the Czech Republic, particularly when this issue has already been covered in much greater depth and in a more appropriate context in the Adam report. There is no reason to pick on the Czech Republic, and certainly not on Temelin. This would simply be underestimating the dangers presented by many others. We need to show some understanding for the Czech Government, which has few alternatives for meeting its energy needs. I hardly think that brown coal can be seen as a viable option, because of the huge environmental damage that it causes. So we need to adopt a more positive approach towards the Czech Government.', 'Amadeo (NI). ‐ (IT) Mr President, the safety of existing nuclear plants and those under construction, as accession approaches, is a primordial objective, as has been underlined on many occasions by Parliament, by the Commission with regard to the Agenda 2000 package, and by the Council in the context of nuclear safety in connection with the future enlargement of the European Union.', 'In the case of the Czech power station, Temelín, it seems highly unlikely that the maximum safety levels for power stations which is required of applicants for accession will be achieved, particularly in the light of the Czech authorities\" plan to use Soviet‐type VVER 1000 reactors, which are presented as latest generation plants but have actually proved not to be very reliable at all.', 'These reactors do not appear to meet the maximum safety levels we should now be demanding and there are doubts about their viability insofar as their much vaunted energy efficiency is concerned.', 'Considering that the Adam report on nuclear safety, which was approved by this House last March, called among other things for restrictions on the use of RBMK reactors and also VVER Soviet‐built models, which the Czech authorities are now planning to use in Temelin, let us reaffirm the conclusions submitted by Alleanza Nazionale\"s head of delegation and the draftsman of the opinion on the Adam report: first, safety is the key element of the pre‐accession strategy; secondly, international legislation on safety systems must be strengthened; and thirdly, the application of such legislation should be supervised by an independent body.', 'We can therefore approve the common resolution submitted today, paying particular attention to environmental protection standards, which are, moreover, the only way of guaranteeing that public health is protected.', 'Sichrovsky (NI). – (DE) Mr President, we welcome this joint motion for a resolution, and we shall support it too, even though the broad support for this motion does remind us, as one of the previous speakers said, that we are in the midst of an election campaign. As immediate neighbours of the Czech Republic, we in Austria are particularly affected by the planned high‐risk reactor. Looking beyond the present motion, however, we take the view that, in the context of its enlargement to the East, the European Union must spell out clearly that accession would be inconceivable unless the applicant countries completely change their dangerous nuclear policy.', 'Let me point out, for example, that reactors built to the same specifications in the former German Democratic Republic were decommissioned after the reunification of Germany. We believe that the financing of this reactor by means of a grant or loan from EU funds would be tantamount to misappropriation on both economic and ecological grounds.', '(Heckling)', \"Is that all you can say about the nuclear power station? Is that all the importance you attach to this subject? It is certainly legitimate to support these countries financially in the establishment of a sustainable energy system. I thank you, Mr President, and I thank the gentleman who felt he had to shout out his statement on this important subject in order to book his place in tomorrow's newspaper.\", 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) I will be brief, Mr President. The Commission understands that the Temelin reactors are, in principle, among those that can be improved to meet acceptable safety levels. And, as indicated in Agenda 2000 and in the communication of March 1998, the Commission\"s overall objective in relation to this type of reactor is to ensure that the improvements undertaken by the respective countries are carried out in a rapid and efficient manner and produce satisfactory results.', 'However, two elements must be taken into account. The authorities in the country where the nuclear power plants are situated are responsible for their nuclear safety. A high level of nuclear safety is a priority in the accession process and the Commission is prepared to cooperate with all the applicant countries to help improve nuclear safety. The Commission is also prepared to help guarantee that the levels of technological and operational safety are brought into line with the safety practices currently in force in the Union. In the Czech Republic, aid has been granted under the framework of the PHARE programme to the authorities responsible for nuclear safety and to improve the safety of the Duckovani nuclear power plant.', 'As regards the specific case of Temelin, the Commission does not have sufficient information on the current state of progress. At the moment, there is no formal agreement with the Czech authorities under the PHARE framework to allow the European Union\"s technical safety bodies to carry out an overall safety assessment. The Commission has taken careful note of the opinion on Temelin set out in the report published by the WENRA regulators. This report does not provide sufficient information to allow us to reach a definitive conclusion on the level of safety that has been reached.', 'As regards the economic aspects of the Temelin project, the Commission supports the development of an energy strategy that gives due consideration to energy production and the diversification of sources. The PHARE programme has supported this approach in various projects.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR D.

In view of that, the resolutions that we have tabled this week are very much out of step with events and give the impression that Parliament is out of touch with what is happening.', 'Mr President, I do not know procedurally what should be done, but I ask you with your superior knowledge of procedure to invent some way in which we can take account of this event and show that we do follow the live process rather than sticking to dogmatic positions that bring nothing new and contribute nothing to the solution of this tragedy.', 'President . – I am afraid there are no procedures that would allow us to come back to this issue.

And it certainly must not encourage those Member States which regard even this as far too heavily binding.

Recognition of qualifications for liberalised professional activities', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the report by Mrs Gebhardt (A4‐0253/99) for the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the Directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications (3612/99 – C4‐0209/99‐96/0031(COD)).', 'Gebhardt (PSE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that my last speech of this parliamentary term contains some good news. The directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in commercial, craft‐related and industrial trades is out of the woods. We can approve the outcome of the detailed conciliation discussions between Parliament and the Council with a clear conscience. Even though the European Parliament has not entirely succeeded in securing acceptance of the decisions it had adopted by large majorities at the first and second readings, we have nevertheless achieved our main objective.', 'This primary objective was to ensure that a vocational qualification obtained in one Member State of the EU is equally valid in the others. That will be the case in future, even though our proposal on aptitude testing suffered a few knocks. The important point, however, is that we have done something for the freedom of those in commercial, craft‐related and industrial trades in the European Union to obtain employment and set up businesses in any Member State. The directive will not trigger a flood tide of new migrants, but it is a particularly valuable mechanism for young people. In a situation in which high unemployment weighs more heavily on us than almost any other problem, fair distribution of the existing work assumes enormous importance.', 'In the third directive on the recognition of qualifications, we are contributing to the fair distribution of work. Newly qualified people in particular, who have no family ties to impede their mobility, can go where their labour is required. They need not stay in the place where they have learned their trade if their skills are not currently in demand there. I believe that, for the sake of strengthening the civil rights of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, we can endure a tinge of disappointment. The slight disappointment is that, in the host countries, migrants will not always be free to choose between an aptitude test and an adaptation period as a means of proving their knowledge and occupational skills.', 'As a parliament, we wanted this freedom to be granted unreservedly to those qualified in commercial, craft‐related and industrial trades. We took the view – and we stand by it – that all migrants will know how they can best prove their aptitude. Any restrictive set of rules is a superfluous bureaucratic obstacle, in our eyes. The Council sees the matter differently, and we had great difficulty in moving it towards the ultimate compromise during the long and arduous negotiations. It was quite obviously under heavy pressure from representatives of craft and trade federations, which would evidently prefer to revive the medieval guild system. That, at least, we were able to prevent, but we did not achieve our aim.', 'The parliamentary delegation followed a consistent line at the negotiations but showed itself willing to compromise when the need arose, and this approach was successful in saving our Council interlocutors from a headlong rush into the past. I do not suppose that the Council will show its gratitude at the next opportunity by adopting a more flexible approach, but I am certain that this Parliament will accept what we have done for young people and their vocational development. A large majority would serve as a signal to those young people that we intend to act quickly to improve their vocational prospects through this third directive on the recognition of qualifications.', '(Applaus)', 'Caudron (PSE). – (FR) Mr President, Mrs Gebhardt, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights and, more specifically, our colleague Mrs Gebhardt, for the excellent work that they have all done and the determination they showed during the conciliation procedure. The negotiations with the Council were certainly not easy, but despite this they ended in a compromise which I personally think is quite satisfactory.', 'In this area it must be recognised that, although progress has been made over the last thirty years in moving from sectorial directives to more general horizontal directives – in particular the key directives of 1989 and 1992 – there was, and there still is, a great deal of work to be done. I therefore obviously support the proposals aimed at repealing the sectorial directives, which were supposed to be temporary and have often continued longer than necessary, resulting in serious restrictions to the freedom of movement and freedom of establishment of European citizens across the Union.', 'With regard to the more general system of recognition of qualifications, I am also in favour of improving and consolidating the system, because although in theory the level of recognition of qualifications is satisfactory, it is not exercised sufficiently in practice. European citizens are too often faced with problems when they try to have their qualifications recognised, and they are often refused employment because of supposedly insufficient qualifications. As a Member representing a border region, I am in a position of having to deal with these problems almost daily, in Belgium and in France.', 'To conclude, I would like to say that these are serious problems, because they are damaging to the very idea of citizenship. It is impossible to convince Europeans that European citizenship exists if they are daily being denied a fundamental right, the right to employment. This is why, Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again, and to take note of the progress that has been made, but to say that in this area too, our battle is far from over.', 'Malangré (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of what I should like to say, let me also express my thanks to the rapporteur and my respect and appreciation for her work. Cooperating very harmoniously, not least with Mrs Fontaine, who chaired the conciliation meetings, she managed through a very astute approach, a firm hand and indefatigable persistence to make this compromise possible. That was indeed a fine piece of work.', \"Everyone who attended those meetings was able to see at first hand how difficult it is to move the Council even a fraction of an inch. Our rapporteur's achievement was truly prodigious. As has already been emphasised, the crux of the matter is freedom of movement in the Community. This freedom would effectively be a joke if migrants could not practise their trade or profession in the country to which they have chosen to move. At the same time, it is a matter of ensuring that freedom of movement is not restricted to unskilled labour; on the contrary, the success of the common market and the people who work in it depends on a high standard of exchange among the Member States. That is the core of the directive now before us.\", 'Qualifications should be obtainable and usable. The way that this should happen was what we ultimately managed to find. What we found was not a perfect solution, but, as has rightly been said, a tenable compromise that provides a common path for all to follow. My group is therefore happy to endorse the report and will vote for it. Thank you once again for all your work.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Conciliation Committee\"s adoption of a joint text on the recognition of qualification. And, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt in particular, as well as the chairman and members of Parliament\"s delegation to this Conciliation Committee, for all the work they have done over the past four months to obtain this joint text.

As we still have a need for statistics on trade in goods within the Community, Intrastat was established, and firms were obliged to supply the necessary information to enable this body to establish the statistics. Firms, and particularly SMEs, were of course not enchanted with the idea.', 'In June 1997, the Commission presented us with two proposals to simplify the 1991 regulation, with the aim of reducing the obligations for firms, and particularly SMEs, in terms of tax returns, and to reduce costs for those liable to pay tax. Even during the first reading, it was clear that in the Council the Member States were not even prepared to support these proposals, even though they had been toned down in relation to the results of the first study carried out within the framework of the SLIM initiative.', 'Despite this, at first reading we tabled amendments to limit the tax return burden, to remove non‐relevant information, for example means of transport and optional information, in order to limit the number of SMEs obliged to provided detailed statistical information. Their aim was also to simplify the use of combined nomenclature, while preserving a single nomenclature for intra‐Community trade and trade with third countries.', 'We pointed out that this was only a first step in the right direction, while awaiting a more fundamental simplification, especially as the reliability of the Intrastat statistics is unfortunately inversely proportional to the costs that are borne by the 450 000 firms that have to supply the data.', 'With the exception of one detail, we had the Commission\"s blessing on the amendments that were unanimously adopted at first reading. However, the Council then forwarded to us a common position that further weakened the original Commission proposal, which had already been weakened in relation to the results of the SLIM studies, and which we wished to strengthen by means of our amendments. Moreover, that common position would have resulted in an increase in the tax return burden for firms. The Council even went so far as to simply refuse to adopt a common position on the proposal for a regulation concerning nomenclature.', 'In the face of such a negative attitude from the Council, we refused to give in. We retained our amendments at second reading, and we went to a Conciliation Committee. We reached the following compromise: as there is no common position on nomenclature, we were able to obtain a declaration from the Council promising to consider the position on nomenclature, taking account of Parliament\"s amendments and of the results of the discussions currently taking place within the framework of a second SLIM initiative.', 'We achieved this result because, in the Conciliation Committee, I was able to confront the Council delegation with the decisions of the Ecofin Council of 18 January 1999, which state, ironically, that the current Intrastat system holds more details than is necessary, that it should be simplified, that costs should be limited and that the 1991 regulations should be modified.', 'I thought I must be dreaming when I read that, as the Council had presented us in July last year with a ‘decaffeinated\" common position on the proposal to modify the 1991 regulation. In December 1998 we maintained our amendments against the common position, and then in January 1999, the Council discovered that there was a need to modify Regulation (EEC) No 330/91. Meanwhile, the Commission proposal had been on the table since 2 June 1997 and there had been two readings in this House.', 'Is it that in the Council, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing? Is this an illustration of the obvious political malfunctioning of the Council? How is it possible that in January 1999 the Council can demand a much greater simplification of the Intrastat regulation, which it had refused in July 1998, forcing us to go to a Conciliation Committee? Make of it what you will! In any case, I am pleased to have persevered at second reading, and I also welcome the Commission declaration promising to submit a report to us on the Intrastat system.', 'If I had to estimate the cost of the work that has been done since 1997, it would certainly be inversely proportional to the results, which are even more meagre when compared to the ambitions of the first SLIM study and to our ambitions for reducing the burden on firms. However, at least the Council\"s contradictions have enabled us to make a new start, which we hope is more promising than what we have had to go through on this issue over the last few years.', 'Paasilinna (PSE). – (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a very successfully drafted report. It is a most pleasurable opportunity to say this on a day like today, the penultimate day of this parliamentary term. I believe that through conciliation we have achieved a compromise, which indicates that both the codecision procedure works well and that Parliament has demonstrated its strength.', 'The directive which went to conciliation is important for small companies, and, hence, the issue of employment. In the European Union there are approximately 18 million SMEs, and almost 17 million unemployed. This comparison of figures already suggests that we must do our utmost to ensure that the SME sector is able to remove the burden of bureaucracy and complexity from its shoulders. By reducing the amount of data that has to be provided on statistics on trade, we are making an important difference to those SMEs which do not have the resources to produce and maintain complicated sets of statistics. The compromise that was reached in conciliation will ease the burden for SMEs, which hopefully will then mean that those companies can put this part of their expenditure and endeavour to better use, thus boosting employment.', 'In the European Union and Member States the role of labour‐intensive SMEs in particular has been considered central to improved levels of employment. If we can continue to simplify matters for them in the areas of thresholds and obstacles, that will be a good thing. The euro is an important factor for small companies, as it removes the need to exchange foreign currencies in the single market area. Small companies do not generally have the means or skills to monitor currency situations to keep them completely up‐to‐date on how exchange rates are behaving. This being the case, the single currency will be of great benefit to SMEs, lowering, as it will, the degree of risk they encounter in the single market.', 'During the conciliation process Parliament also had the opportunity to send a political message to the Commission on another matter that was being dealt with. This too demonstrates the strength of the codecision procedure. Now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been in force for just under a week and the role of the codecision procedure is growing in importance, perhaps we have reason to congratulate ourselves, Parliament, and the triumph of democracy.', 'Rübig (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Lulling for her very committed efforts on behalf of SMEs and other businesses. She rightly recognised that firms need less red tape so that they have more time for their customers, and that this also provides an opportunity to create new jobs. I would also like to thank Mr Paasilinna, who has always given this initiative his strongest support and who has shown us the way in this field. I would also very much like to thank the Commission, because the research we were promised as part of the SLIM‐Intrastat initiative, looking particularly at the issues of quality and the burden on the economy, is extremely important.', 'Commissioner, this research is very important for us in Europe. We are always talking about relieving the burden of bureaucracy and supporting firms in order to create new jobs. This is a real opportunity to find a new approach. I think it is very important that we have decided to cut down on the number of people required to provide information, as well as reducing the amount of information to be given, although we do, of course, want to have an acceptable level of information. What we want, in other words, is a good cost‐benefit ratio, so that the exercise is a profitable one. In Austria we are shortly to hive off the Central Statistical Office, making it into an independent profit‐making operation. People using the data will have to pay for doing so, because if the data are worth anything, then there should be a price to pay.', 'I would also stress that we have made great efforts to use a single nomenclature for internal and external trade, and we are reducing the number of sections from eight to six, which I think is very important. We need to have data that are manageable. They will not be broken down so finely, but they should still provide a clear overview of the market.', 'We should also welcome the fact that the transport sector and supply conditions have been dropped. What we want is to be able to obtain really efficient data rapidly. They should be collected in computerised form as far as possible, and we should encourage firms to supply them voluntarily, using systems of incentives rather than fines. We must see to it that the most up‐to‐date statistical methods are used, such as random sampling, market research and opinion surveys. I think that this will bring us much closer to the people, and we will then be more readily accepted by businesses, have greater room for manoeuvre on the world market and thereby create new jobs.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) In the framework of the SLIM initiative, the Commission presented two proposals for a regulation on 30 May 1997 with the aim of simplifying the basic legislation on the Intrastat system. Their objective is to relieve the burden on those who have to provide statistics.', 'In the first proposal, the number of compulsory variables to be provided in declarations was reduced, and in the second, the nomenclature of products used to classify traded goods was simplified.', 'As regards the first proposal on reducing the number of variables covered, the conciliation procedure allowed us to reach a satisfactory result on the Commission\"s initial proposal. This result was obtained through the combined efforts of our two institutions – Parliament and the Commission – and we are very pleased about that.', 'The joint text agreed in this way represents an important step in the work to relieve the burden on businesses, and particularly SMEs. To be specific, from 1 January 2001, small and medium‐sized enterprises will no longer have to provide five variables. However, the Member States will retain their option to request the ‘delivery terms\", ‘mode of transport\" and ‘statistical procedure\" variables for businesses that are above a certain threshold.', 'As regards the proposal on simplifying the nomenclature, the Commission notes with satisfaction that all the institutions acknowledge the importance of simplifying the combined nomenclature. Its importance is highlighted in the joint text through a specific recital to this end.', 'Moreover, the Commission would like to point out that the Council is willing to examine the proposal for a regulation on this matter.', 'In conclusion, the European Commission is satisfied with these specific simplifications, which businesses will soon benefit from, and would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on her excellent report.', 'However, this is only the first step. The Commission is committed to continuing with the SLIM/Intrastat initiative and the EDICOM actions for businesses, in accordance with the Council\"s position on the need for information in the framework of economic and monetary union.', 'Lulling (PPE), rapporteur. – (FR) Mr President, this morning I protested about the fact that this report is being debated this evening and that we will vote on the third reading tomorrow, which is Friday. I know that Friday should be a complete working day for all Members, but unfortunately absenteeism among Members is legendary on Friday mornings. I would like to point out that, in the ten years that I have once again been a Member of this Parliament – I was previously a Member from 1965 to 1974 – I have been present at all the Friday sittings, and if I am re‐elected on 13 June, I will show the same level of discipline.', 'Things being as they are, I nevertheless regret that Parliament is setting a dangerous precedent by voting on a Friday morning on a third reading, something which in my opinion should be done by qualified majority, so that we can reach the heights of the powers that Parliament has worked so hard to achieve. I know that a simple majority is stipulated, but that is completely illogical. If we vote by qualified majority at second reading, there is all the more reason to do so at third reading. In this respect there is also a great deal of work to be done on our Rules of Procedure, and I do not think that we are doing ourselves any favours by setting this precedent tomorrow. I hope that this will not be the case for much longer. I know that these are only statistics, but it does cost the 450 000 firms more than EUR 500 million to supply the data, and what is at stake is just as important as any other conciliation report.', 'President . – I understand the point you are making, but it is not our Rules but the Treaty that sets down that we require a simple majority for third reading. I accept what you say about Friday, but in terms of the parliamentary calendar, it is a normal working day.', 'Lulling (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, I hope that next time a very controversial conciliation report is being discussed, we will also vote on Friday morning, with 20 votes to 18, or something of the kind!', 'President . – I am just a servant of this House. I merely follow the agenda.', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.']}, {'topic': '9. Insolvency practices', 'paragraphs': [\"President . – The next item is the report by Mr Malangré (A4‐0234/99) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on insolvency practices.\", 'Malangré (PPE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this own‐initiative report is Parliament\"s contribution towards closing a very sensitive loophole in internal market legislation. Much of this single market legislation is, as we know, very well advanced, I am glad to say. However, despite three attempts we have still not succeeded in finding a solution to the problem of Community insolvency law. This is the unavoidable downside to the great success of the single market. As we know and are extremely happy to see, many businesses are taking advantage of the single market to operate in other countries and now have sizeable assets in various Member States of the Union.', 'When insolvencies occur, however, the confusing legal situation with, at present, 15 different bankruptcy systems creates great scope for manipulation, generates enormous costs in complicated proceedings and makes it extremely difficult to ensure that the assets are fairly distributed among the creditors. Here too – and this is something we would stress – the idea of introducing remedial measures through an intergovernmental agreement, thereby excluding Parliament, came to nothing. However, I will not deny that I have great sympathy with what the Commission has been trying to do since the early 1980s, or at least with the substance, but not with the idea of using an intergovernmental agreement.', 'This Commission draft was an outstanding and extremely knowledgeable legal text, but it was not accepted. The subsequent attempts – the Istanbul Convention and the last one that failed in 1995 – tried other routes, but they too missed the mark. Nevertheless, we need a Community solution, which is why I call in my report for a draft directive or regulation to be put forward as soon as possible. We urgently need to have this on the table, and most of the preliminary work was done in the three earlier drafts. If we take the approach of demanding directives or regulations, we are ensuring that Parliament will be involved and that there will be a majority decision, which experience has shown to be clearly what is needed here.', 'My report contains a number of proposals which improve on the agreement that failed in 1995, and we would ask you to consider them. I think they are essential improvements which can be incorporated. I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for all its hard work. We held a hearing that produced a very clear outcome, and we were unanimous in demanding an urgent solution to this insolvency problem.', 'I would just mention that four amendments were tabled in committee which were all positive and supported the line taken in the report. I was therefore happy to include them and can now put before you a proposal that was approved by the entire committee. I would urge you to vote in favour of it tomorrow.', 'Oddy (PSE). – Thank you Mr President. I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important report and I agree with his suggestions. I regret, too, that the convention has not been ratified by all Member States and would stress that we need to find a solution to this very serious problem. I agree with the demand of the rapporteur to draft a regulation or a directive on crossborder insolvency.', 'I want to flag up though that we need a solution which finds a fair balance for creditors and employers and employees alike. Employees need some protection for accrued salaries and creditors need a sensible solution which will give them the best possible repayments of debts under the circumstances.', 'I would also flag up a point made by my colleague, Mr Falconer: I am sure he will not mind me saying this. He is particularly concerned that, in insolvency situations where someone later develops an industrial disease, a solution is found whereby they can be recompensed for industrial disease problems.', 'I agree that this is an urgent report and that it is crucial to find a solution swiftly. Indeed, to show how urgent it is, I was lobbied about this at an international banking meeting in Paris in spring 1994. That shows how longstanding the issue is.', 'I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group. My Socialist Group will be supporting the report and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work. It has been extremely nice working with Mr Malangré over the years that we have both been in Parliament.', '(Applaus)', 'Wijsenbeek (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, I should like to begin where the previous speaker left off, by expressing my great admiration for Mr Malangré. He has produced a report that is as sound as a bell. I myself have a personal connection with this subject, since my very first report, on an amendment to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, dealt with the bankruptcy of the Ferrovie San\"Anna, which was very unusual at the time, a steel company going bankrupt. The High Authority, which was responsible for the social side of things, seemed to come last in the queue, while first the State, then the social services, the suppliers, the banks and anyone else you cared to mention all helped themselves to whatever was left over from the liquidation. So I said to Commissioner Cristoffersen that the situation could not be allowed to continue, because there were so many different bankruptcy systems in the European Union, and it was high time that we had the possibility of creating European limited companies whose creation and termination would both be jointly regulated.', 'Now, in my last speech at the last sitting I shall attend as a Member of this Parliament, bankruptcy is on the agenda again and it has still not been regulated. As Mr Malangré described in his explanatory statement, which as I said is absolutely first‐class, it is high time that we did something about bankruptcy in the Community at European level. There are twelve different systems for suspension of payment in Italy, and in Denmark all creditors are treated equally, even the State and the social security authorities. We need harmonisation here, otherwise any attempts to create European transfrontier companies will be doomed to failure. I support the Malangré report, to which I have been able to make a small contribution through my amendments in the Legal Affairs Committee, which have been included. I and my group wholeheartedly endorse it.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament\"s initiative to support the adoption at Community level of legislation that allows us to determine the legal and economic effects of the bankruptcy of companies operating within the internal market. Such legislation does not currently exist. The effects of insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State upon goods and people situated in another Member State depend on national legislation and on bilateral agreements between the Member States.', 'The Community has always attempted to compensate for this shortcoming in the context of the smooth running of the internal market and, to this end, it launched two types of initiative in the 1980s.', 'Firstly, the Member States began to negotiate an agreement on the basis of ex Article 220 of the EC Treaty. This agreement aimed to regulate in a horizontal manner the intra‐Community effects of bankruptcy by determining the legal competences and the law to be applied in declaring a business insolvent. These negotiations culminated in the signing of the 1995 Convention on Insolvency Proceedings, on the basis of which we are debating today.', 'Secondly, the Commission presented two directives on the liquidation of insurance companies and credit bodies. These proposals are based on the principle of the authorities\" powers in the country of origin where these companies are authorised to operate.', 'The Commission hopes that the two directives will be adopted as soon as possible. Until now, however, neither of these two initiatives have been successful. We are awaiting their adoption with bated breath.', 'The 1995 Convention on Insolvency Proceedings had still not been signed by all the Member States before the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force and, as a result, it cannot be implemented.', 'Retaining its use of the right of initiative, the Commission is assessing how the text agreed by the Member States in 1995 and could be brought into effect within the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty.', 'Wijsenbeek (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, I am sorry that the Commissioner must be feeling that he is getting the third degree here. He said that the 1995 Convention has not been signed by all the Member States and the Commission is now considering doing something about this. Will the Commissioner promise that the Commission will come up with either a directive or a regulation here – we leave that to the Commission to decide – so that we no longer need to wait for these countries to make up their minds?', 'President . – Mr Wijsenbeek, I have been very tolerant but I cannot allow the dialogue to continue. We have to conclude the debate. I would like to add my own personal thanks to Mr Malangré for all the work that he has done in this House and to wish him every success in the future.', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.']}, {'topic': '10. Lawful interception of telecommunications', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the report by Mr Schmid (A4‐0234/99) on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs for a Motion for a Resolution on the lawful interception of telecommunications in relation to new technologies (10951/2/98 – C4‐0052/99‐99/0906(CNS)).', 'IN THE CHAIR: MRS SCHLEICHER\\nVice‐President', 'Schulz (PSE), deputising for the rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I move on to the subject of this debate, there is something I would like to say to Mr Malangré, who is leaving this House after 20 years as a Member. You know that there are personal reasons why I am addressing these words to you. We are, if you like, opponents and competitors in politics, since we both come from the Aachen region. You were mayor of that important European city for 16 years and alongside that a Member of the European Parliament for 20 years. I was mayor of Aachen\"s smaller neighbour for just a few years, and we did our best to get our hands on your trade tax by stealing your biggest factories. However, this has not affected our friendship or the work we have done together for Europe. I think I can say on behalf of many in my group that you have been one of the most honourable and reliable Europeans in this House. Many thanks for all your work!', '(Applaus)', 'The Schmid report deals with an extremely sensitive subject – the modern communications society on the threshold of the 21st century. People value their privacy, and every democratic country has legislation which protects its citizens against arbitrary State interference in their private lives. This is why the police are only allowed to tap telephones or intercept faxes and letters under lawful conditions, and then only in certain strictly limited cases and only with a court order. The conditions for such activities are regulated under national law, and rightly so.', 'This draft Council Resolution on the lawful interception of telecommunications does not interfere with national law here, since whether we like it or not, resolutions under the third pillar have this somewhat circumscribed nature. In future, under the Amsterdam Treaty, it will be more accurate to call them ‘common positions\", but they will still have no binding legal force. They simply indicate that the Member States have agreed on a common course of action. A resolution was used in 1995 to agree what interception meant in the technical sense, such as whether only the content of a telephone conversation should be recorded, or the time and the recipient\"s telephone number as well.', 'There are two reasons for having these telephone and fax agreements between the Member States. Setting up interception facilities involves costs for the system operator, but in the single market the level of costs must be similar everywhere if distortions of competition are to be avoided. So one country cannot impose costs on its operators which are not charged in other countries.', 'Secondly, in the case of cross‐border requests for legal assistance, we need to be clear about what interception actually means. The draft resolution before us extends the scope of the agreement to include mobile telephones and Internet communications. This is an extremely sensitive area. It is a logical extension because it will protect people\"s privacy, but it does not mean that we are protecting a particular technical communication medium. The two must be clearly distinguished.', 'There is opposition to these agreements and the planned procedures, which is very interesting and is worth looking at more closely. There are some Internet freaks who are very concerned that we are trying to interfere with their freedom to communicate and think that free communication is under threat. They need to realise that the Internet is not outside the law, and that in a democratic society there cannot be any areas where people can just do what they like. I was Parliament\"s rapporteur for the establishment of joint measures to combat child pornography, and I can tell you that what is happening on the Internet cries out for some form of regulation, however hard it might be to put into practice.', 'The Internet service providers also have some misgivings because of the costs involved. We have included an amendment in the report to answer these concerns. There is also no fixed timetable for implementation, which is a weak point. There is opposition too from those with an interest in money laundering and tax evasion. The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights, Mr Florio, has expressed such misgivings. He has been good enough to air the concern that regulations on interception might also be applied to bank transactions on the Internet. The ‘Handelsblatt \", which is hardly what you would call a Socialist newspaper, wrote last December, and I quote, ‘The Internet is the ideal medium for tax evasion. A firm called Privacy Solutions is openly advertising itself on the Internet with the following words: ‘Your office is in cyberspace, the tax authorities will never find you!’\" People have a civil right to protect their privacy, but there is no civil right to crime, money laundering or tax evasion!', 'Anyone who totally rejects the lawful interception of modern communications, which we have heard many speakers do, is simply aiding and abetting criminals, albeit unintentionally. However difficult it may be to translate joint agreements into practical action, it is absolutely essential that we should recognise that the freedom which the new telecommunications give us is still something that is open to abuse. This is an appeal to the sense of responsibility of those able to take advantage of this freedom, but it is also a challenge to the national authorities to find intelligent ways of stopping these freedoms from being abused, which is harmful to the public interest and creates particular problems for the tax system and the collection of taxes. My colleague Mr Schmid has tried to contribute to these efforts in this report.', '(Applaus)', 'Cederschiöld (PPE). – (SV) Mr President, the interception of telecommunications is a sensitive matter, since it touches upon the personal integrity of ordinary people. We are engaged in the eternal process of finding the right balance between safeguarding that integrity and combating crime. Nobody wishes to see Orwell\"s Big Brother take over, but nor do we want to expose the public to uncontrollable levels of crime. The current exercise is simply a matter of updating an existing resolution on telecommunications interception, bringing it into line with modem technology. This is a very low‐key text from the legislative point of view. National legislation is not infringed upon; Member States implement the provisions only if they so wish, and in the way they choose.', 'The State has a duty to fight crime committed within its borders. It bears responsibility for anti‐crime measures and supports the cost. This applies in the United States as well. Costs arising in connection with the interception of telecommunications are currently borne by the State, and should continue to be so. This is especially relevant at a time like now when telephony markets are being privatised. Increased costs would make life harder for small Internet providers, undermining Europe\"s competitive edge. Internet providers can, after all, set up anywhere in the world; we do not want rising costs to drive them out of the European Union.', 'Success on the advanced technology front is vital for Europe\"s development. We cannot afford any deterioration in the growth potential of the IT industry. There is currently scope for expansion in the sector, particularly for small and medium‐sized companies. They are the ones that would suffer if they had to bear the costs of generalised data storage.', 'Personal integrity must be at the forefront of any debate on anti‐crime measures. Sophisticated data inspection requirements offer one solution. Equally, we will need a preventive strategy to stop the Internet from becoming a playground for criminals.', 'Across‐the‐board storage of information naturally puts us in mind of Orwell. If the State takes charge of the costs, however, we will have some degree of assurance that only such information as is absolutely necessary will be saved. There must be a decision from a court; the exact nature of the information required will need to be specified; this data must of course only be used if there is suspicion that a very serious crime has been committed; and no action should be taken on statements from informers. This whole area is rightly regulated in an extremely strict way in almost all countries. I can therefore see no reason why Parliament should seek to block this move. On the contrary, we in this House need to demonstrate that we can perform the balancing act required and contribute towards an unfettered information society, without allowing the Internet to become a vehicle for crime. Mr Schulz has warned us about that. So, in the interest of combating crime, I would commend this proposal.', 'McKenna (V). – The EU FBI telecommunications surveillance system is developing rapidly through two separate but very linked initiatives. First, the Council has proposed a new draft Council resolution to extend the 1995 requirements resolution to cover new technologies, the Internet and satellite‐based telecommunications. And, second, the Council is on the verge of agreeing a formula to provide a legal base for remote access to a satellite ground station in Italy through a new clause in the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.', 'This draft convention will provide the legal framework for the interception of all forms of telecommunications in the EU which is required to put into effect the EU FBI surveillance system. Both measures are expected to be agreed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 to 28 May.', 'What we are discussing here today, in the version discussed in the European Parliament, amends the 1995 requirements to include data on Internet users such as IP address, electronic address assigned to a party, account number and e‐mail address (ENFOPOL 10951/98 REV2).', 'That has actually been changed. What we are discussing now is not the actual wording, because what it says instead is: ‘IP address\" and instead of ‘account number\" it says ‘credit card number and e‐mail address\".', 'It is very disturbing that an issue like this is being discussed on a Thursday evening when there are very few people here, the vote will be tomorrow morning, and there has been no proper debate within national parliaments on this issue. There has definitely been no debate within the Irish Parliament and I do not think there has been debate within many of the other parliaments.', \"If it is possible to monitor communications in such a manner you will be able to tell where a person is, when they are there, what sites they are consulting, what electronic messages they are sending, what electronic payments they are making, basically you will know everything about a person's private life.\", 'The Greens believe that this is a serious attack on privacy and there are not sufficient safeguards regarding data protection and democratic control. This is something that was actually brought up by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which was very critical of this. It is unfortunate that the draftsperson of the opinion is not here because it is extremely important that this point is stressed.', 'Rules on telephone tapping are controlled, for example, at national level. That follows very proper procedures and authorisation. This proposal here basically ignores the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the provision on the protection of private life in Article 8. These are being overwritten here and interference by a public authority should be subject to extremely strict conditions. The view of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken on board.', \"The other point I wanted to make is that this whole issue was discussed in a procedure which was a written procedure, not in a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. This issue has not, as far as I am concerned, followed the proper democratic procedures. It has not been discussed in national parliaments. I also feel it is very sinister that this issue is put on the agenda on the Thursday night when everyone is going back to campaign for the election. There is absolutely nobody here to listen to what is going on. This is a grave step against people's right to privacy and right to freedom.\", \"It has always been the case in Member States throughout the European Union and right around the world that oppressive legislation is brought in using the argument that we have to combat serious crime. For example one of the speakers mentioned paedophilia and things like that on the Internet. That does not mean that you overwrite people's basic right to privacy. That is what is going on here. There needs to be a lot more debate about this, not just here in the European Parliament but in national parliaments. I would like to know why these issues have been railroaded through in such a fashion without proper democratic control and proper public debate.\", 'Nassauer (PPE). – (DE) Madam President, lades and gentlemen, the mere mention of the idea of telephone tapping is enough to get the relevant circles talking about a police state and ‘Big Brother\", just like Pavlov\"s dogs. What the Legal Affairs Committee has given us here is the sort of arrant nonsense that you might expect to hear from a first‐year student, but from the second year onwards you would have to call it out‐and‐out troublemaking. Mr Schulz pointed out quite rightly, and Mr Schmid wrote, that this Council recommendation makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to the legal situation in the Member States.', 'The legal conditions for telephone tapping and for monitoring Internet access will still, even after this resolution, lie solely in the hands of the national legislator. The resolution simply aims to harmonise the technical standards, which we need to do in order to use telephone tapping to prevent organised crime.', 'Let me give you an example. Virtual bank accounts can be used to collect extortion money: a blackmailer sets up a virtual bank account and has the money paid into it, and if access cannot be monitored, he cannot be held responsible or brought to account. This is why it is absolutely vital that these measures are taken now. The Council has made a recommendation, and we have a resolution before us that is essential if we are to combat organised crime.', 'The Member States will certainly introduce all the constitutional requirements that are needed to register something as sensitive as telephone tapping or Internet monitoring. But we need to make provision for ways of combating organised crime.', 'Schulz (PSE), deputising for the rapporteur. – (DE) Madam President, I do not want to take up too much time unnecessarily, but Mrs McKenna made two points that I feel I have to take issue with. Mr Schmid, for whom I am deputising, has not stayed away deliberately. His report was actually on the agenda for this morning, and this afternoon he had a private appointment, not a political one, that he could not put off. I apologise on his behalf, and I would assume that Mrs McKenna criticised his absence simply because she did not know the reasons for it.', 'The second point is one that I simply have to reject. The committee responsible here in the House is called the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. No other parliament in the world, I think, devotes as much care and attention as ours does to basic and human rights if there is any question of interference with civil liberties in the construction of a European legal area. You know, Mrs McKenna, that as well as being the spokesman on internal affairs for my group I am also the vice‐chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights. I categorically reject the claim that the careful work which we are doing – whether it is Mr Nassauer, myself or Mr Schmid – is designed to railroad something through that goes against the guarantees of basic rights enjoyed by individuals in the European Union. I have to say that I think these are rather harsh allegations, and because I value you as a colleague I would ask you to consider carefully in future whether you can substantiate them.', 'McKenna (V). – Madam President, on a point of order. I was not criticising Mr Schmid for not being here. I did not mention his name. I was talking about Mr Florio because he was the draftsman of the opinion in the Committee on Legal Affairs. The Committee on Legal Affairs has the opposite view to the Committee on Civil Liberties.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Madam President, I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Schmid on his excellent report on the lawful interception of telecommunications.', 'The Commission shares Parliament\"s opinion of the importance of this issue, particularly since in Europe the telecommunications world is constantly undergoing rapid and revolutionary changes.', 'On the one hand, we must take into account the logical concerns of the police authorities. The development of Internet telecommunications must not affect the Member States\" ability to fight crime and maintain national security. On the other hand, we are seeing a significant increase in telecommunications services and, in particular, Internet services. Information technology companies already account for more than 5\\u2009% of the European Union\"s gross domestic product. They provide employment for more than four million people and they create more new jobs than any other sector of the European Union\"s economy. As a result, the Union is obviously extremely keen to remain at the forefront in this age of information.', 'Moreover, if this sector is to continue to expand, it is essential that we are able to ensure that users trust the telecommunication services. The European Commission therefore believes that it is vital to maintain an appropriate balance between the interests at stake. In our opinion, this can only be achieved through open dialogue between the police authorities, the operators and the industry.', 'As highlighted in both Mr Schmid\"s report and the opinion by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights, there is a series of aspects that must be addressed in more detail. We thus need to clarify issues such as operators\" liability as well as privacy in telecommunications.', 'The Commission should like to begin a broad debate on the necessary requirements and on the way in which these can be met in as beneficial a way as possible. This debate could lead to the Commission making full use of the new opportunities provided by the Amsterdam Treaty and submitting proposals on this issue. Only in this way will we be able to protect the development of the information society.', 'President . – Thank you, Commissioner.', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.', '(The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.)', '(1)']}]}\n",

Approval of the Minutes', 'paragraphs': [\"President . – The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.\", 'Are there any comments?', 'Valdivielso de Cué (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, I would like to make a point regarding a letter I received from the President\"s office on 20 April in response to a request for information on the procedures followed in relation to the petition forwarded by the spokesman for the Areeta residents\" united platform in the province of Álava. I was born there and still live there, which is why I am very interested in this matter. This document was included in the European Parliament\"s list of documents received on 12 April and I was informed that it was to be officially announced at the beginning of Parliament\"s sitting on 3 May, that is, the day before yesterday.', 'I have checked the Minutes from Monday and Tuesday, but this document does not appear in either of them. Some might say that this is not an important issue, but such matters are very sensitive in communities that are undergoing restructuring. The town involved has spent the last four years campaigning to have the area\"s sewage treatment plant moved two or three kilometres away in order to get rid of the bad smell. It is a sensitive petition and I feel that the correct procedures should have been followed. I would ask the President to kindly ensure that this reasonable and just petition is advanced as soon as possible.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Valdivielso. We shall check on all the details of the matter you have raised.', 'Trakatellis (PPE). – (EL) Mr President, I received a letter from your office which said that, as there was to be a debate on Kosovo yesterday afternoon, the questions to the Council that I and other colleagues had tabled for this afternoon would not be discussed.', '‐ Firstly, we did not manage to get speaking time from our group to present the question during yesterday\"s debate.', '‐ Secondly, as you will see from the Minutes, the issues we were asking about were not covered during yesterday\"s debate either by the Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, or by Commissioner van den Broek.', 'Our question concerned the environmental impact, and the impact on public health, of the bombardments taking place in Kosovo. I would be very grateful if my question and the questions of my colleagues, which are of course related, could be discussed this afternoon in the Council, as originally planned. Thank you very much, Mr President. I hope my request will be granted.', 'President . – Mr Trakatellis, according to paragraph 2 of Annex II, Part A, a question shall be inadmissible if the agenda already provides for the subject to be discussed with the participation of the institution concerned, in this case the Council. The issue of Kosovo is included as one of the subjects in the topical and urgent debate. As a result, we cannot accept any questions relating to Kosovo during this sitting, as has been the case in other sittings, for the simple reason that the Rules do not allow it.', 'McKenna (V). – Mr President, as you know, Members of this Parliament have, over the years, been extremely critical of any kind of censorship, in particular cultural censorship. They have also been very strongly supportive of gay rights. I should like to know why an exhibition by a lesbian artist was banned from this Parliament. This is a very crude form of censorship, there is no justification for it and I should like to know what part you played in banning this exhibition. At the end of the 20th century to ban an exhibition by a gay artist is completely unacceptable and no Member of this Parliament should endorse that.', 'President . – Mrs McKenna, I already explained to you on Monday that this decision was taken by the Quaestors, who followed the recommendation of the services responsible. The decision had nothing to do with whether or not the artist was a lesbian – I do not know if she is or not – but with the fact that it was felt that the content of the exhibition would have been offensive to some Members and some of the people passing through Parliament. That is why we refused to host it.', 'Morris (PSE). – Mr President, going back to the same question regarding the possible use of depleted uranium in Serbia and Kosovo, a specific question was asked to go on the agenda of Question Time, a specific question, not a general point as we had yesterday from the President‐in‐Office of the Council. The question regarding the use of depleted uranium oxide in Kosovo or Serbia was not addressed. Therefore, can you reassure us that we will be given the opportunity to receive some answer on this very vital question?', 'President . – You know perfectly well that these have to be written questions. What I can do is have an oral question in this session because we have the subject of Kosovo on the agenda. You could have asked the Members who spoke in the name of your group to raise the question. If they do not deem it necessary to do so I cannot make any other arrangements.', '(The Minutes were approved)']}, {'topic': \"2. Statement by the President of the European Parliament on the occasion\\nof the conclusion of Parliament's fourth term of office\", 'paragraphs': ['President . – Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this week\"s part‐session is the last in our term of office and my last as President of this House. It is therefore time to give credit where it is due: to you, ladies and gentlemen, and, through you, to all the people of the European Union whom I have endeavoured to serve during the last two and a half years.', 'In the letter I sent to you in December 1996 asking for your vote, I spoke of five challenges the Union, and therefore its Parliament, would have to face: five major challenges to be met in two and a half years.', 'The first was the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was underway at the time and from which Parliament emerged a winner, with greater powers and in a stronger position to serve the people of Europe better.', 'Secondly, we had to begin the negotiations on enlargement. Parliament has promoted these negotiations energetically and is continuing to pay careful attention to them. We hope to ensure that all the applicant countries are included in the process, with the only differences arising from the rate at which each country adapts.', 'Our third aim was to launch the euro. We participated actively and constructively in this process, ensuring that the transition to the new currency did not take place at the expense of consumers. We also wanted to guarantee that the new directives for the European Central Bank were given the necessary preparation and independence, and that this House, which represents all Europeans, received adequate information on monetary policy.', 'Fourthly, the financial perspectives and Agenda 2000 had to be reviewed. We contributed to this decisively through proposals and amendments aimed at maintaining and improving our common acquis . In my view, the coordination of the work of the many committees involved and the cooperation with the Council and the Commission have been of the highest order.', 'Our final objective was to prepare our institution for the coming European elections. These elections are not a matter of electing the poor relative of the Community institutions but of electing a Parliament that the people see for the first time as a Parliament that has great power and the ability to exercise that power.', 'The balance between the European institutions has, in fact, changed to become what was intended in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties: the appointment of the Commission and its political activities are no longer dependent on the confidence of the Council alone, they also depend – and this is crucial – on the confidence of Parliament. This confidence is not something that can be earned once and for all. The Commission must maintain this confidence right through its term of office and it must answer to Parliament when necessary, providing – without any reservations or reluctance – all the information the House needs to enable it to carry out its supervisory role.', 'For years, there have been calls for more democratic European institutions. We must not lose our nerve or seek a return to the previous balance between the institutions: that is of no use any longer. Democracy means having to be the channel for the European public\"s growing demand for information, and to welcome or condemn what is being done in each case. This, rather than anything else, is what Parliament has done.', 'In my letter of nomination, I also talked about internal reforms and the uniform Statute for Members. Many reforms have been adopted in the last few years in relation to the way in which our House works:', '‐ we have improved our standards and financial organisation;', '‐ we have completely changed the top levels of Parliament\"s administration and introduced new systems of promotion and mobility at all levels;', '‐ we have increased the number of women in senior posts, although we have not yet reached the levels I would have liked;', '‐ we have regulated the transparency of administrative decisions, at the request of the Ombudsman;', '‐ we have brought together and clarified the existing rules so that, from now on, both Members and officials will be aware of their rights and obligations, according to clear rules that prevent arbitrary behaviour or favouritism.', 'We also managed to find a satisfactory solution to the technical and financial problems surrounding our buildings in Brussels, thereby completing the efforts of my predecessors to provide Members with more functional and compact facilities. I hope that the same can happen with the building in Strasbourg and that work on that can begin during the next term of office. This recent stability in terms of real estate policy has allowed us to provide Members with new computer programmes and resources that make it easier for them to have direct contact with the people.', 'As regards the Statute for Members, I want to make it very clear that this is an ambition of Parliament and is in no way a discipline imposed by the Council, as some people claim. That is why I wanted to remind you that it was included in my letter. It was Parliament that asked for the legal basis for the Statute to be included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and this request was met. It was also Parliament that presented the Council with a very comprehensive text, even before the Treaty entered into force, covering all the aspects of our situation as transparently as possible, even those aspects where it has always been our responsibility to take decisions.', 'We must welcome the fact that the Council has joined in with this movement – which is in my view unstoppable – and has made great efforts to reach a consensus among its members. But some parts of the text proposed need to be corrected in terms of their form or substance so as to ensure that fundamental principles are not violated. I am thinking here of the principle of fiscal equality among all Members: temporary exceptions may be permitted but never permanent ones. I am also thinking of the respect for Members\" pension rights in relation to the years they have worked both within and outside Parliament and of other points of detail that I do not need to go into now.', 'In any event, it is clear that we will continue to call for a uniform statute, we have gone ahead and adopted measures to control our allowances and travelling expenses and significantly reduce them without waiting for the Statute to be introduced. Few institutions or bodies – national or otherwise – within this Union are capable of taking such decisions on their own initiative, as we have done.', 'The basic aim of all these reforms was, and is – and the people should be aware of this – to increase the efficiency and transparency of Parliament. We hope to pass on to the incoming Members a House that is ready to face up to its institutional role and the challenge presented by greater awareness on the part of our fellow citizens.', 'All in all, the results over the last two and a half years have been positive. However, there have been both successes and failures along the way. It would be remiss of me to overlook our most distressing failure: our inability to ensure that our repeated warnings about the approaching tragedy in Kosovo were heeded. Now we are having to watch with horror as the black clouds of hatred we warned of rain down persecution, blood and violence. We are having to watch how the absence of adequate instruments to implement peace there has left us powerless to prevent an act of genocide.', 'We can, however, throw ourselves into helping the victims. This is what we are doing and we will have to continue our humanitarian work for a very long time. But it is not enough. We must now begin to pave the way for peace and to collaborate with the countries in the region to build a stable system of cooperation between them and promote development so that they can join our Union as soon as possible, a Union that is based on respect for differences and on the integration of its wealth and its cultural and human diversity.', 'It is a Union where there can be no room for exclusive attitudes or racism and xenophobia. These evils always have a tendency to sprout new shoots, and we can never let up in the fight against them because, given the slightest opportunity, they can so easily turn into violence, suffering and death. Parliament has been – and will undoubtedly continue to be – one of the most active participants in this struggle.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I began with a personal assessment and have ended up with a collective assessment of achievements that have come about as a result of your work, your determination and your sound judgement, as well as the active and loyal cooperation of all the staff of the Secretariat who provide the House with their services, the freelance workers, the parliamentary assistants and everyone else involved. I would ask you to give them a round of applause to express our recognition of their work and our gratitude.', '(Applaus)', 'I think that we should give special recognition to our colleagues who are now moving on to new pastures in their political or personal lives. This House owes a great deal to their dedication and intelligence. They have helped build a more democratic Europe that is closer to the people and we should thank them for that.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I have had the privilege of presiding over the work of this House in the firm belief that the best way of reducing the democratic deficit in the Union is by promoting this Parliament and raising awareness of it among the people of Europe. There can be no real democracy where there is no real parliament, nor can there be a real parliament if it does not cause the executive a certain amount of anxiety and inconvenience.', 'As a result, there have been many moments of tension and many difficult negotiations throughout the last two and a half years. I have tried to face these with determination and with total dedication and effort, and without flinching when it has been necessary to defend Parliament\"s decisions and actions. On no occasion did I wonder whether or not other institutions would be pleased with the way I was defending Parliament; I simply looked on it as my duty. When I was young, I was taught that that was the only way to act in politics with dignity, and I have tried not to forget that.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I will finish as I began over two years ago, by thanking you for your support and also for your criticism. I consider myself to be a democrat and I therefore take such criticism as it is meant: as help rather than an insult. In my view, it is wise to listen to critics and ignore flatterers.', 'I have been moved by the passion of Europe, which has allowed the utopia of fifty years ago to become, for the most part, a reality. We must continue to develop Europe with this same passion and increasing unity, prosperity, freedom and solidarity. Thank you very much.', '(Loud Applause)', 'Martens (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, I should like to thank you for this assessment which you have presented to Parliament. I believe we can safely say, as you emphasised, that in the course of this term the House has developed into a genuine Parliament. The major achievement of your presidency is undoubtedly the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is thanks to your efforts, perseverance and credible convictions, coupled with the efforts of many Members, that Parliament won the right to genuine codecision in the legislative process. Everyone in this House knows that this would never have been achieved without your efforts. The European Parliament, our Parliament, has developed into a political institution whose voice within the European Union cannot be ignored and which has exercised its political and budgetary control with great authority and great independence. I consider this to be an exceptionally important development which also constitutes a democratic counterbalance to the European Union\"s other two political institutions.', 'You carried through the parliamentary reforms which were initiated by your predecessor Klaus Hänsch, encountering many difficulties in the process. In many ways this was not an easy task, especially as the Council did not always fully understand the importance and complexity of the reforms and because – I believe – it was not sufficiently aware, particularly in the most recent period, that we could not allow certain principles of a free Parliament to be violated. The reforms have not actually been completed, which must have caused you some disappointment. But much more importantly than all of this I believe that you have acted out of your genuine belief in Europe rather than any kind of pragmatic Realpolitik. The European enterprise to bring peace, reconciliation and solidarity to the people of Europe is more than an ideal for you: it is your life\"s work. I should also like to add a personal element here. This conviction has been passed on from father to son. I shall never forget the time when, in the early 1970s, as the young chairman of my party, I attended a meeting with your father in a cinema in Madrid. Few people were present and the circumstances were not easy, but under your father\"s leadership we were even then able to clearly communicate the ideals and conviction of our beliefs, of the Christian Democratic values and principles and above all our belief in a federal Europe. You also embody these same principles.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, there have been two Presidents during this parliamentary term, neither of whom, I believe, have held government office, but who worked and grew in stature here in Parliament. These two figures represented us with credibility and force before the Council. As prime minister of my country I noticed how the Presidents of Parliament were sometimes only allowed to attend the European Council for a few minutes. Fortunately this is no longer the case. Both of you, Klaus Hänsch and José Maria Gil‐Robles, represented and defended our Parliament in a very credible manner and achieved some outstanding results. I should therefore like to thank you both personally. We remain true to the ideal. We will continue to work towards it, albeit in very different circumstances. My sincere thanks for all you have achieved.', '(Applaus)', 'Green (PSE). – Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to join with Mr Martens in paying tribute to your work, to your profile and to your commitment as President of this Parliament over the last two and a half years. You have presided over one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the European Union and the life of this Parliament, as you yourself said in your speech: going from the intergovernmental conference, through the introduction of the euro and indeed through the unexpected ratification process of the new Commission – that though we had not quite timetabled or expected it – has also been dealt with.', \"The last six months have been the most tumultuous six months of the life of this Parliament. You, Mr President, have ensured that Parliament's role in this entire period has been clear and has been effective.\", 'I want to pay, in just a few words, particular tribute to your sensitivity and your human qualities, if I may. You have been accessible to Members of this Parliament. You opened your doors in a new and innovative way to backbenchers, as President of the House. That has been very much welcomed and respected by Members here.', 'You have always been accessible, certainly to me, as leader of my group, when I have needed to talk or to see you, your door, or indeed your telephone, has always been accessible to me. I thank you personally for that. It has helped on occasion, as you know, to sort out or to ease certain issues and events through the life of this Parliament. I thank you on behalf of my group for that.', \"You are leaving the presidency at the end of what I have already described as a tumultuous six months. Parliament's prestige is enhanced at the end of this period. It is a coincidence, but perhaps a fortunate one, that this very week when we are in the last week of the life of this House, we are also in the first week of the life of the Amsterdam Treaty. It is fitting that it should be like that and we will notice the change to the rules that were made to bring in the Amsterdam Treaty. Yesterday, for instance, during the vote, 39 reports were dealt with in one and a half hours which is probably something of a record.\", 'I thank you, Mr President, for your role and the work you have done and would just like to join Mr Martens in saying that you are indeed a thoughtful, deeply committed and heartfelt European.', '(Applaus)', 'Cox (ELDR). – Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I too want to be associated with the words of thanks to you for your term of office. It has been – indeed, even as we finish it – and remains an extraordinary and eventful term. It represents a term when European democracy itself, when parliamentary democracy has reached a new level of maturity. In some ways, as we enter, in terms of direct mandates, our twenty‐first year we have now achieved this new age of maturity. I believe, with your help, particularly when we have dealt with many of the sensitive political controversies of recent months and the Conference of Presidents, we have been able to hold together, with the stresses and strains and points of emphasis that groups may wish to bring to debates, a coherent parliamentary view. That is in no small measure a result of your role in the Chair.', 'I am aware also, of the extent to which, in your many years of service in this House, you personally were committed to issues of institutional reform. Therefore it must be an issue of great personal satisfaction that, having given so much of your particular attention to institutional matters, you should preside over this last session under the new Treaty of Amsterdam.', 'I can confirm in the several months that I have had the privilege of leading my own group the courtesy which you have shown to me – which I acknowledge here today – and also confirm the extraordinary openness with which you do your business. You are a frank and decent man to deal with. I deeply appreciate the openness you have shown to me when I have needed your advice and assistance. May your future go well.', '(Applaus)', 'Puerta (GUE/NGL). – (ES) Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak at the end of our term of office, which is beginning to seem like the end of the academic year, when students finish their university classes and pleasantly say goodbye to each other, remembering certain students and teachers, and there is a generally friendly atmosphere. I am glad there are days like this when the heart rules.', 'I must admit that I completely forgot about this formal sitting. As a result, what I am saying to the House on a personal level has not gone through any political filter, and at the moment I have to say that I would vote for both you and Mr Hänsch again. This does not always happen.', 'My group asked for a political assessment and, despite all the criticisms we have made, the work of the various political groups throughout this term of office has been very valuable.', 'I would like to stress three aspects of your work. The first is your efficiency, which meant that you had to make yourself available at all times. The second aspect is your complete independence from possible pressure from governments and parties, and this is vital. You gave priority to your role as President of Parliament. Undoubtedly, there were ups and downs, but I will not go into them here. However, it is not easy to fulfill the institutional role to which you were elected with complete independence every day, Mr President, and I thank you for this. I am a member of a medium‐sized group – it is certainly not small, since 34 Members constitute a medium to large group – and I have to say that we have never noticed any discrimination. You have treated all the groups in exactly the same way, according, of course, to our degree of support among the people.', 'As far as Parliament is concerned, I think it is fair to say that the dominant feature of our term of office has been that we have left behind our short trousers. Being a man I am using the example of short trousers, though of course I do not mean to be in any way sexist. We are now an adult Parliament. We no longer need to set out Parliament\"s responsibilities over and over again.', 'The public are aware that this is a Parliament of truth. They are more aware of that than they are of the Treaty of Amsterdam, since, as a Spanish journalist said, the Treaty is colourless, odourless and bland. The Treaty of Amsterdam does not attract much attention, although we are very much aware of it in Parliament because of our legislative work.', 'The fact that we have now become a mature and adult Parliament is very important for democracy, as democracy cannot work on the basis of good intentions or personal contributions alone, as we all know. It requires institutions that go further than human beings, that ensure that the work of Members who are not returning will be continued by other Members. That is the greatest merit of the institutions of democracy.', 'Parliament has often been critical of and hard on the Commission. Mr Santer is here today and I would like to express my own personal gratitude to him. We must thank Mr Santer for accepting Parliament\"s role. And here I am also thinking about the future, when one day the Council too – the omnipotent Council – will have to come before Parliament to face up to its political responsibilities and account for certain decisions. When that happens, Parliament will have fully come of age to the benefit of the people of Europe.', 'Wolf (V). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I will have to represent our group because I am the only coordinator here present. And I am happy to do so. But let me say in advance that I come from Schleswig‐Holstein and am also a Green, both of which make it difficult for me – unlike Mr Puerta who is so extremely good at it – to utter the usual words of praise. It is not the custom where I come from, nor is it the custom in my party!', 'Mr President, I think I can assure you that we all have great respect for you. We really have been most impressed by your composure, your ability to handle differences and opposed views, and I personally have learnt to value not just your sense of fairness but also your awareness of the growing tasks facing this House, for during this legislative term this House has grown at least a head taller. And perhaps we have got over the problem of the short trousers – you know an incident occurred during the Conference of Presidents, at which I appeared in short trousers. Everyone survived that with great composure too – after all, it was very hot!', 'Parliament really has gained in stature and weight now. We have achieved that under your presidency, Mr Gil‐Robles.', '(Heckling)', 'I have not gained weight! That is a misinterpretation.', '(Laughter)', 'We have gained in political weight. I do not think anyone here in the House can mistake that. You, Mr President, have been active in your office and really stood up for the equal rights of all Members; you took active and successful steps to ensure that we now obtain a common European statute instead of a medley of national statutes. One instead of 15, surely that is a qualitative step forward! In that regard, and I do not think it is only my group that believes this, your term of office really was successful and you have done this Parliament great services. Muchas gracias, Señor Presidente !', '(Applaus)', 'Collins, Gerard (UPE). – Mr President, it is with the utmost pleasure, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, that I say a very sincere word of thanks to you for the very able leadership which you have given Parliament over the last two‐and‐a‐half years. I do not wish to repeat what has been said by colleagues who have already spoken but it has been a very great two‐and‐a‐half years. We will always remember Amsterdam; we will always remember the European single currency. We will also recognise and appreciate in the future the stronger and greater links that you have established with the applicant countries, helping to foster democratic and parliamentary values there. We will always remember you as a person who has shown very great leadership at all times and someone who was open, friendly and accessible to Members of Parliament. That is important. But above and beyond that it is recognised that you are a man of strong conviction with many natural human qualities; a person of great energy and determination and a person who has always been positive and even‐handed; a person who is encouraging and indeed, a person who can be very firm and authoritative when that sort of authority needs to be shown, as we have witnessed on occasion.', 'As well, we will always remember you as a person with a good sense of humour. That has helped on occasions, particularly at meetings of the Bureau when we were getting bogged down on sensitive matters and you never failed to see the wood for the trees. You always got us out at the end of the day.', 'I thank you very sincerely for what you did in relation to bringing a greater degree of openness and transparency to the workings of this Parliament. This was essential. There was no way out of it; we had to face reality. You certainly played your part, following on from the very fine work done by your predecessor Mr Hänsch in ensuring that we could, at this particular time, be in a position to face the electorate in a way that we could withstand the criticisms and cynicisms that were going to be directed at us.', 'I hope we can continue down that path despite the one or two problems that are there. In this regard I would say a special word of thanks and appreciation to the German presidency for the great work they did on the Statute and bringing us to where we are today. But for you, Mr President, for the presidency and Parliament helping, we would not be where we are. We still have that last furlong to travel. I hope that we get there.', 'I believe you had a very successful term of office, Mr President. I thank you for it. You put tremendous effort into it. Parliament has responded to your leadership. Parliament is undoubtedly becoming more and more, as a result of your leadership, meaningful to the ordinary citizens of the Member States. That is something we must continue to achieve right up to the end.', 'Duhamel (PSE). – (FR) Mr President, I want to make a point of order that is a matter of form and will take only a moment. I have not been a Member long enough to know what Rule allows the French Socialists to join in the praise for your work on behalf of us all. But I felt I should do so, on the basis of whatever Rule Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy would have found had he been here.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Duhamel. Thank you to everyone for these kind words, which I truly appreciate. I shall continue to work in Parliament as a Member, and I can assure you that I shall continue to do so gladly with all of you, in the same spirit.', 'Bonde (I‐EDN). – (DA) Mr President, a word of thanks is most certainly also due from your ever‐devoted, critical and constructive opposition. I too would like to say Gracias, Presidente on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, and to acknowledge the fact that something happens to our Presidents when they are first elected. They suddenly change from being political opponents into cooperative, humorous, agreeable and impartial colleagues, and we really do have a very good, cooperative community within the bodies that control Parliament. And you are no exception in this respect. You have continued the work of Mr Hänsch, and I would very much like to thank you for that.', 'I suppose that I can now be counted as one of the veterans of the House, and I can recall how at one time the political group chairmen would lead the way when it came to wasting expenses and being driven around in limousines with chauffeurs paid for by Parliament, while in the meantime travel refunds were being drawn from the Members\\' cash office for the same trips. That was not so many years ago, but now we have the opportunity to take stock, as it were, and to thank you for having helped, together with Mr Hänsch, to clean up this kind of waste. Since 1994, the President of Parliament has been at the forefront of the clean‐up operation. We must thank Mr Hänsch, because he set this work in motion, and Mr Gil‐Robles, since he continued it. But there was also a time when this House was a ‘Mickey Mouse parliament\" which acted most irresponsibly in financial matters. Thirty‐eight times we have tabled a motion proposing that travel expenses should be based on receipts submitted. Hopefully this will now happen, but we must first get through an exercise this afternoon. Now all of the group chairmen are leading the way in the battle against abuse, whereas previously they were the leading abusers. So in this area at least, a change has taken place, but unfortunately the political group chairmen are still in the minority in this House. We shall see evidence of that this afternoon. Hopefully, the chairmen will get a majority behind them in the Parliament that emerges after 10 June, so that a clean‐up can finally take place with regard to travel expenses, because we are certainly not there yet. The proposal which has been adopted in the Bureau means that for my journey from Copenhagen to Strasbourg, I get EUR 450 more in travel expenses than I received before the cost‐cutting measures were set in motion. So there is still some way to go.', 'And so, Mr President, I would very much like to thank you for having also played a part in the campaign for greater openness within the EU. Over the past five years, a consensus has been created within Parliament with a view to working towards greater openness. And Parliament has decided by a large majority that all documents must be public unless we decide by a two thirds majority to prohibit access to them. There is a consensus on this stance in Parliament, but unfortunately this is not yet the case within the Commission and the Council. Under the Amsterdam Treaty, we are now contending with Commission proposals which do not mean a greater degree of openness, but perhaps if anything less openness.', \"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mr Oreja, because after 20 years' work we have succeeded in getting the Commission's internal telephone directory officially issued, with a covering letter stating that within a few months everyone else will also be able to get hold of it, once the prototype has become a real telephone directory. And so, after 45 years with a secret telephone directory, it will in a few months also be possible for the general public to track down the person in the Commission who, for example, is responsible for issuing telephone directories.\", 'Thank you, Mr President, for your helpful collaboration.', 'Ephremidis (GUE/NGL). – (EL) Mr President, you began with a personal account and then you went on to a collective overview. Please allow me to make a point of order. I hope you will indulge me because of my age and also because I am coming to the end of my term of office and will not return.', 'In your collective overview which, in my view, was given in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which you have always strictly abided by and respected, thereby setting us an example to follow, you should have included the fact that this Parliament is coming to the end of its term of office and that it was unable to prevent war taking place on European soil.', 'In the debate that took place yesterday Parliament was unable to put a stop to the many war crimes and crimes against humanity that are taking place. Instead, the resolutions, the debate and the reports by the Council and the Commission turned the debate into a whitewash of these crimes! This is not a good precedent for the next Parliament.']}, {'topic': '3. European Council of 3/4 June in Cologne – Institutional reform', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the joint debate on:', '‐ the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council meeting in Cologne on 3 and 4 June;', '‐ the oral questions to the Council (B4‐0334/99) and the Commission (B4‐0335/99) by Mr De Giovanni, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the forthcoming institutional reform.', '(1)', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by thanking you, Mr President, on behalf of the Council. It is, of course, a little difficult for the Council to thank the President of Parliament; for if it praises him too much, that is supposed to mean it has done something wrong, which is why I would like to say that you are the Council\"s partner, an uncomfortable partner, conciliating on real issues but quite unyielding when it comes to representing Parliament\"s rights. But we have cooperated well and successfully, for which I give you very warm thanks. Let me also say quite specifically on behalf of the Council that this Parliament took a qualitative leap forward during this term of office. That is thanks to you, Mr President, and to your predecessor, my friend and political companion Klaus Hänsch.', 'After all, it is not just that Parliament has acquired more rights and is asserting them. More importantly, it has become much more firmly anchored in European public opinion than any previous European Parliament, and that is the crucial difference. This Parliament is seen as a genuine parliament, and from the Council\"s point of view I can only say that it is taken seriously as such, indeed more and more so. Mr President, I wish you all the best, both personally and politically.', 'I now come to the matter in hand. The phase of European development ahead of us is determined by the fact that once again we have to set a number of important signals. In Berlin we wanted to secure the financial bases of the Union up to the year 2006 with Agenda 2000, with particular reference to the tasks relating to enlargement. Here I want to give particular thanks to Parliament for its constructive approach to this question over the past weeks.', 'After Berlin sought to protect the Union\"s financial ability to act, the Cologne summit will now endeavour also to protect and strengthen its political ability to act in the long term. The Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force a few days ago, a historic breakthrough. The Treaty provides the European Union with a wider range of instruments but at the same time raises new questions to which we shall have to find answers in Cologne. However, our activities are overshadowed by an issue that dominates all others, the conflict in Kosovo and the accompanying human tragedies. That was debated here in depth yesterday afternoon, so I need not go into it again in detail. I just want to establish again that against the background of developments in the Balkans, over the past weeks the European Union has demonstrated its unity and resolve, from the joint declaration by the Heads of State and Government of 24 March to the General Affairs Council\"s decision last week to toughen the sanctions.', 'The Council continues to maintain that on the threshold of the 21st century Europe cannot allow the numerically largest ethnic group in Kosovo to be collectively deprived of its rights and subjected to severe, systematic human rights violations. We must ensure that hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons can return to their homes. No ruler should be able to claim that persecution and murder are a matter of internal policy. That is the lesson of the 20th century. We must also repeat that for us this Kosovo conflict is not just a matter of humanitarian objectives and humanitarian questions. It is also a matter of the general European perspective of our policy of integration and of the long‐term security and stability of Europe as a whole.', 'If Milosevic achieves his aim of a Kosovo no longer inhabited by Albanians, that will create a source of crisis in a region that is in any case not very stable and could lead to numerous new conflicts. The aim of stabilising south‐eastern Europe will become remote and there will be no prospect at all of integrating that part of Europe. Europe would remain incomplete. That is why it was so important to look beyond the military objective and set out a political plan for pacifying the entire region.', 'The German Presidency of the Council took the initiative and made the necessary proposals. The Heads of State and Government supported the German proposals at their meeting on 14 April in Brussels. Last week the Council decided to begin preparing a stability pact for south‐eastern Europe, an initiative that the entire international community now firmly welcomes. Together with the international organisations and the neighbouring states concerned, we will hold the first working meeting on 27 May and will hold the first conference of foreign ministers on 11 June.', 'It is against this backdrop that the European Council will be meeting in Cologne on 3 and 4 June. While the Council will have to take a serious look at current developments in Kosovo, it must not ignore the other central issues relating to its political ability to act.', 'Cologne will look at the following major issues: firstly, the European Employment Pact; secondly, the timetable for the forthcoming institutional reform; thirdly, the European charter of basic rights; fourthly, the common strategy towards Russia; and fifthly, the further development of the European security and defence policy.', 'Let me say a few words on these points. Unemployment is the most urgent social problem of the present time. Thanks to the Employment Pact, which we hope to adopt in Cologne, we want to give the people of Europe a sign that the European Union is looking at their concerns. The pact is to become the expression of an active labour market policy that seeks more than before to avoid unemployment, in other words that looks above all at reducing youth and long‐term unemployment and at ending the discrimination against women on the labour market. We want to interlink the national and European level measures to promote employment more closely and link them to a coordinated monetary, financial and wages policy as also to economic structural changes.', 'A working paper submitted by the German Presidency was discussed for the first time and positively received at the informal ECOFIN Council in Dresden in mid‐April. The idea of also involving the social partners and the European Central Bank in the future dialogue on fiscal, wages and monetary policy found strong support.', 'Another important item on the Cologne agenda will be institutional reforms. In accordance with the request of the Vienna European Council, it will have to be decided in Cologne how and when to tackle the institutional questions not resolved by the Amsterdam Treaty and that have to be resolved prior to enlargement. The Presidency of the Council will shortly be submitting concrete proposals on the subject with a view to Cologne. At present we are still at the stage of intensive consultations with the Member States. Insofar as Treaty changes are required to resolve these questions, they will have to be agreed in the framework of a conference of Member State government representatives. Pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, a formal hearing of the European Parliament will also be necessary before such a conference is convened.', 'But initially Cologne will be concerned only with the further procedural steps, with laying down the procedures, the timetable and the agenda for the intergovernmental conference. The Amsterdam protocol on the institutions with a view to enlargement of the European Union, together with the declarations on the subject, provide the framework for the intergovernmental conference, but we might indeed have to go further. The developments early this year that led to the resignation of the Commission and to a discussion about reforms certainly give reason to examine the relations between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission in this regard. I think it is most important to build on the democratic control that the House has exercised so effectively here. We must fully restore confidence in the institutions; we must not have a repeat of the institutional crisis we have just gone through.', 'In the view of the presidency, it is essential to further strengthen the European Parliament. The more able the European Union becomes to act, the more its actions and decisions must have democratic legitimacy. That also means, for instance, that in all cases where the Council adopts legislative acts by majority vote – and we want to make majority decisions the rule – the European Parliament must have equal codecision powers on an equal footing.', 'The careful preparation of the intergovernmental conference will be vital to its successful conclusion. Here we will be able to draw on the comprehensive preliminary work that was carried out during the intergovernmental conference on the Amsterdam Treaty. Given this time‐frame, the intergovernmental conference could be convened as early as the beginning of next year and brought to a conclusion in the course of the year 2000. That is an ambitious aim, but I believe that a short and clearly circumscribed intergovernmental conference could send out an important signal about the European Union\"s ability to enlarge and about the effectiveness of its institutions.', 'Irrespective of whether the institutional questions left over from Amsterdam are resolved, we will have to look in the medium or long term at the question of the constitution of Europe. The German Foreign Minister, Mr Fischler, pointed out here in Parliament that following Maastricht and Amsterdam the question of a European constitution is now more serious than it once was. We know that the Amsterdam Treaty only entered into force a few days ago and we must begin by gathering experience from it, because even now the comprehensive debate on the future development and form of the European Union is showing more and more clearly that in addition to the European Parliament the national parliaments and the broadest possible spectrum of social groups must also be involved.', 'The German proposal to draw up a European charter of basic rights also belongs in this context. Our initial aim for Cologne is to be asked to draw up a charter of this kind. At the given moment we will have to consider whether and how this kind of European charter of basic rights can take precedence over the European treaties. We need to tell the people of Europe that their basic rights apply in the same way at European level as at national level. The first talks on this charter of basic rights have now begun and I am sure that we will manage to agree on the further procedure in Cologne.', 'Formulating this kind of charter of basic rights would be a typical task for Members of Parliament – they are best able to do so and it is what they must do – and we will certainly take account of that aspect in our proposal concerning the practical form that charter of basic rights should assume.', 'The Amsterdam Treaty has markedly enhanced the Union\"s ability to act in foreign policy. Even if the Union is already demonstrating great solidarity now – as in the Kosovo crisis ‐we still need to develop the common foreign and security policy further. If ever there was a need for a common European foreign and security policy, then it must be now, and it is time for all doubting Thomases to hold their tongue. We need it; Europe can no longer accept the fact that it has become an economic world power and yet does not even have the political power to resolve its regional problems.', 'One way of achieving this is through the CFSP High Representative to be appointed in Cologne, as provided by the Amsterdam Treaty. Another is the common strategy towards Russia that we want to adopt for the first time in Cologne and which we will be able to implement on the basis of majority decisions. This common strategy towards Russia is a pilot project; it will very much determine the face of future common strategies. Work has already begun on further common strategies, but they will not yet be ready for decision‐taking by the time of Cologne.', 'We also need a European security and defence policy if we are to implement a common foreign and security policy. Here it is clear that collective defence in Europe will remain the task of NATO; but the European Union must also develop its own military crisis‐management capability for cases where the European Union or WEU believes there is a need for action but in which our North American partners do not wish to or cannot be involved. Tony Blair\"s initiative in Pörtschach and the Franco‐British meeting in St Malo gave fresh impetus to this question.', 'After the creation of the single market and economic and monetary union, the formulation of a European security and defence identity has now become central to the European integration process. Without it that process would remain incomplete. During our dual presidency of the EU and WEU, we are resolutely endeavouring to make use of this new dynamic. We intend to draw up a report on means of further developing the European security and defence identity by the time of the Cologne European Council. That report will form the basis of a new European Council decision in Cologne that concretely defines the further procedure in this important policy area. Among others it will cover the question of possibly integrating the WEU in the EU, pursuant to Article 17 of the Amsterdam Treaty.', 'As you can see, even without the additional challenges facing the Union as a result of the crisis in Kosovo and the resignation of the Commission, there is a wide range of tasks to be dealt with in Cologne. As you know, however, situations of crisis can also release forces and produce their own dynamism; the German Presidency remains confident that it can match up to its responsibility to develop the European Union into a pan‐European and at the same time global community that has the ability to act. It hopes that here it can continue to count on the support of the European Parliament. Thank you for your attention.', '(Applaus)', 'Santer, Commission. – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cologne European Council comes at a decisive moment for the European Union. The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May marks a further step forward. A newly elected Parliament will take up office in a few weeks\" time. There is also to be a new Commission. Later this morning you will be voting on the appointment of the future President, Romano Prodi. The new President will need the support of the European Parliament to make a success of his term of office. All these factors need to be capitalised on to give European integration a fresh boost. Lessons need to be drawn from the past with a view to preparing for the future. Now is the time to prepare the ground for the institutional changes ahead.', \"Before discussing this and replying to Mr De Giovanni, I would first like to briefly run through the other issues due to come up for discussion at the Cologne European Council in a month's time.\", 'The situation in Kosovo will of course be discussed. The European Union will obviously be called upon to play a major role here. First, there will be the reconstruction phase where the Commission will have a coordinating role alongside the World Bank, for which it will need adequate support and resources. The Union will then have to devote itself to defining a genuine strategy for stability in the Balkans, and Cologne will be an important step along the way.', 'Cologne is also where the first common strategy under the Amsterdam Treaty is due to be adopted. As you are aware, this common strategy concerns Russia. This is no easy task, if only because the Council and the Commission do not, in the end, have all that much time available, but we are making good progress. This is all the more significant in the context of the Kosovo crisis. It is more important than ever to maintain and develop constructive and close political, economic and commercial dialogue with Russia. The Kosovo crisis is also a stark reminder of the need for a proper European defence identity. Following the progress made at the Atlantic Alliance summit in Washington, the European Union will need to adopt a solid stance.', \"As regards the economy, the prospects for growth in 1999 are not looking quite so good. But there are some positive signs. Consumer confidence, which has remained high, is gradually taking a hold on businesses, whilst the drop in the European Central Bank's key interest rates is also grounds for optimism. It is nonetheless clear that alongside the requisite budget consolidation, Europe will also need to speed up the structural reforms of the employment, goods, services and capital markets. It was with this in mind that the Commission recently adopted its recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines. This comprises specific country‐by‐country recommendations, including economic reform issues. I hope these recommendations will be discussed openly and thoroughly this year. The coordination of economic policies should not just be left on the drawing board.\", 'The Commission will also be reporting on the development of the trans‐European networks and hopes that the European Investment Bank will make its contribution, as it did at the Amsterdam European Council in 1997.', 'Moreover, the European Council will discuss a report by the Ministers of Finance on the structure of international finance. The crises in Asia and Russia highlighted the need for reforms in this area. Progress was made during the discussions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington just over a week ago. However, I would have liked to have seen Europe genuinely speaking with a single voice.', 'Let us consider, for example, debt relief for the poorest nations: why should each of the European G7 countries have to come up with its own relief plan? Why should we leave it to our partners, in particular the Americans, to organise the Community\"s external representation for the euro, rather than acting on the decision taken at the Vienna European Council?', 'Cologne is set to be interesting from the employment point of view. The Luxembourg process has taken root and is starting to produce results in terms of national employment policies that are more systematic, integrated and far‐reaching. At the instigation of the German Presidency, we will be taking a further step towards the European Employment Pact which I called for back in January 1996. To help the discussions, the Commission will be sending the European Council a communication on the best way of integrating the objective of higher employment into the formulation and implementation of Community policies and measures.', 'Cologne will also see the forthcoming institutional reform begin to take shape. It is not, of course, for me to speculate what submissions Romano Prodi and the new Commission will want to make to prepare the ground for institutional reform, or what they will wish the reform to involve. I would, however, remind you that even when it was putting Agenda 2000 together, the Commission called for the questions first raised at Amsterdam to be settled and said that a more far‐reaching reform should follow.', 'Any delay in strengthening the institutions and the way they operate can only jeopardise the actual enlargement of the Union. The new reform must prepare the institutions for enlargement. But it must also supply solutions to certain problems in the working of the institutions which have come to light in the last few months. So the institutions need overhauling, that much is certain. But the overhaul must focus on the priorities, rather than just drawing up shopping lists, knowing, as we do, that we must not project the alarming image of Europe as a building site which is never completed. There is no doubt that the job needs to be done in stages; but we certainly cannot have a state of never‐ending construction work.', 'I would add that there is no point in dreaming up new reforms if the political will to implement what already exists is lacking. We must build on what we have already achieved. I am thinking, for instance, of the justice and home affairs section of the Treaty of Amsterdam. And I would call on the public and the institutions to take a close look at how intentions are converted into procedures and working methods.', 'Looking beyond the institutional reforms which must be put in place, I would like to plead for a consistent approach. We cannot call for new European programmes, condemn the use of technical assistance offices and refuse to provide more human resources all at the same time. We cannot make high‐sounding declarations about the principle of subsidiarity on the one hand, and constantly demand fresh initiatives from the Commission on the other. We cannot expect the Commission to act as a strong political driving force and at the same time give the impression of wanting to turn it into a mere secretariat for the Council or the European Parliament.', '(Applause from certain quarters)', 'Some issues have already been identified: weighting the votes in the Council and reducing the number of Members of the Commission. But we will have to go further than that if we are to carry out a thorough reform of the Treaty provisions that govern the composition of the institutions and the way they work. Whatever happens, such a reform must include bringing in qualified majority voting as standard practice, as the President‐in‐Office just mentioned. Thought also needs to be given to extending the codecision procedure.', 'Should we go further? Certainly. For example, the thorny matter of collective responsibility and the individual accountability of Commissioners needs to be addressed. The principle that policy decisions are taken collectively is, it seems to me, as vital now as it ever was, for the very legitimacy of the Commission and the European institutional system. But that should not lead to a failure of individual accountability in certain situations where decisions are not and cannot be taken collectively. This contradiction – which is only apparent – will be resolved by the judicious exercise of the new powers enjoyed by the President of the Commission.', 'The Cologne European Council will therefore have to take stands on some major issues. Be it employment, Kosovo, enlargement or the working of the institutions, the European Union must learn to speak with one voice: one voice for the 15 Member States and one voice for the institutions, too. This does not mean that they must always follow the same line. It means that they must work together, that a constructive approach must be taken to enhancing and strengthening the Europe of the future in the eyes of our fellow citizens and to giving it the place it deserves in the international arena.', 'De Giovanni (PSE). ‐ (IT) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first, as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, starting my last public speech, I too would like to thank the President of our Parliament very much for the work we have been able to do together. I sincerely want to pay tribute to him for that, and now I will go straight on to the issue of institutional reform.', 'Institutional reform is on the table again and that is greatly to the credit of the German Presidency, I have to say, right from the President‐in‐Office\"s speech to Parliament in January.', 'Two fundamental issues have been raised: the need to hold an intergovernmental conference very early in the year 2000, with a method and timetable to be discussed, and the issue of the constitution, which Mr Verheugen has taken up, as I was delighted to discover this morning. Why do I consider it important, indeed essential, for institutional negotiations to reopen? Because there is a need for more Europe, there is a need for Europe to have a role in the world. The historical and political context demonstrates that, and without reformed institutions and a strong political will the need for Europe cannot actually be met. And then, as the President‐in‐Office said this morning, the institutional balances are out of kilter and need to be redefined. The Council did well to appoint Romano Prodi as President so quickly, but we all know – and now President Santer has said so – there is still the problem of defining a stronger political role for the Commission. In short, there are institutional balances to be restored.', 'The agenda for the intergovernmental conference must certainly cover ‘the Amsterdam triangle\" as it is called in Community jargon. It must certainly include qualified majority voting, which is not in fact a technical issue, as we all know, but a highly political issue calling into question the sovereignty of the nation states. And the agenda must certainly touch on the composition of the Commission and the way the votes are weighted. We know all that. But we need something else as well, because, as people have highlighted, the background to the intergovernmental conference in 2000 will be complex and difficult, so foreign policy and, above all, the area of freedom, security and justice are issues which must be raised again.', 'In our resolution we raise the problem of the method. We do not introduce fundamental points like Article N, naturally, but we say that changes need to be made at the preparatory stage, because the intergovernmental method has proved inadequate, which is why we need to prepare differently if the intergovernmental conference is to be a success. We are pressing, as we did before in the November 1997 Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos resolution, for a Commission document to underpin interinstitutional coordination involving civil society and national and regional parliaments. To put it as briefly as I can, what we need is a highly authoritative document on the intergovernmental conference table, because preparing for the intergovernmental conference in a different way may guarantee safer results in terms of reform. That is the point! We do not include Article N in the discussion, we do not discuss the need for final unanimity, but we do say we must prepare for this conference in a different way. Why? Because Europe demands it, because Europe needs strong institutions!', 'Let me make one final reference to the issue of the constitution. I am, I repeat, delighted that the President‐in‐Office returned to this subject this morning. We know the problem today is not to write a constitution, as we have done in the past and as we have demonstrated that we are capable of doing. We know there are two problems today. First, there is the need to simplify the principles in the Treaty to present clear rules, principles and values to the public, so that they know what we mean when we talk about Europe and Europe\"s constitution. Secondly, there is the area of freedom, security and justice, where flesh and blood people live and move. Those people need legal and jurisdictional guarantees. That is why we talk about including fundamental rights in the Treaty – Mr Verheugen reminded us of that again this morning – and I believe we can build a political Europe and a people\"s Europe at the same time on that basis because the two either move forward together or do not move forward at all.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr De Giovanni. Given that this is your last speech, I would like to thank you, on behalf of Parliament, for all the work you have done and for your dedication and determination.', 'Gollnisch (NI). – (FR) Mr President, I would like thank you for letting me speak and ask if these statements by the Council and the Commission are to be followed by motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 of our Rules of Procedure.', 'President . – Yes indeed, and they will be put to the vote tomorrow.', 'Gollnisch (NI). – (FR) So they shall be put to the vote tomorrow. This means that a special decision was taken as an exception to Rule 37(4), which states that they should normally be put to the vote on the same day.', 'I just wanted to verify that point.', 'President . – Yes, that has been decided.', 'Medina Ortega (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, before I begin, I would like to add my voice to the statements already made by some of my colleagues, on behalf of the political groups, congratulating you on your work. In this case, because of the personal relationship I have had with the President for a long time, I would also like to congratulate him on having carried out his work so successfully.', 'I also wanted to take this opportunity to say goodbye to Mr Santer as President of the Commission, as I believe that this is the last debate he is going to attend. I would congratulate him, too, on his work while in office.', 'The German Presidency has done a great deal of work since it took over. Contrary to expectations it managed to conclude the Agenda 2000 package, which seemed extremely difficult, and now it has just informed us about the fairly ambitious programme for the Cologne European Council, on which I must congratulate it. In his speech, the President of the Commission set out five very clear points that represent genuine requirements of the Union.', 'The first requirement is the European Employment Pact. The German Presidency is right to give priority to this proposal as, in spite of other issues, there is no doubt that the main everyday problem for Europeans is employment. The only question mark is whether or not the European Union will have sufficient resources in the years ahead to implement an employment policy of its own given that the financial perspective for the 2000‐2006 period has been reduced and practically all Community policies have had to face cutbacks.', 'We are naturally very pleased with the specific reference to an intergovernmental conference in the year 2000, which my colleague Mr De Giovanni has already mentioned. The question of institutional reform was clearly left unresolved at Amsterdam. If it is not resolved, enlargement will be impossible. Allowing all the countries applying for membership of the Union to join under the present conditions would require significant changes to the structure of the EU. This intergovernmental conference will face a difficult task, but I would still like to thank the German Presidency for having addressed the issue so clearly.', 'Of course, the European Union\"s Achilles\" heel is still the common foreign and security policy, and the German Presidency has stressed the need to develop Article 17 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The first step towards creating a European defence identity – which is proving essential – is to incorporate the Western European Union into the EU system. Another important element is the appointment of a prominent figure to be responsible for implementing this policy, in other words the CFSP High Representative. We must point out that, from Parliament\"s point of view, it would have been better to leave this in the hands of the Commission, rather than trying to turn the Commission into a form of secretariat for the Council, as President Santer mentioned.', 'Finally, I would like to end by congratulating the German Presidency – and Mr Verheugen in particular – on the excellent work that has been done since the beginning of the year.', 'Brok (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we have been given an introduction here to the difficult questions facing the Cologne summit, which have to be resolved in our common interest. I am particularly grateful for the fact that so much emphasis has been put on the concept of the common foreign, security and defence policy, for Kosovo shows us how necessary it is that we achieve results in terms both of prevention and of the EU\"s ability to act. If the German Presidency intends to make appropriate use of its dual presidency of the European Union and of the WEU, that is to be welcomed. But it is also important to use the potential offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam in regard to implementing the common foreign and security policy for the genuine good of the Community and not to continue following the old methods.', 'Belatedly, although not too late, Russia is also being brought into the process again. A common Russia strategy, which would establish a balance on this continent and help bring about solutions, is welcome. But here we must not forget that in view of the many disputes we are currently facing in, for example, the field of trade, we should also improve relations with the United States. Mr Verheugen, I would therefore cordially request you to ensure that the US‐EU summit in Bonn on 19 June is also used to strengthen the partnership and cooperation between the USA and Europe, to improve its shape and also to involve the parliaments in the appropriate way.', 'Given the problems of unemployment, the Employment Pact is a most important subject. However, we will be looking very carefully at the outcome of the summit and examine the distribution of tasks in terms of the role of the national states in employment policy and the European role, so as to avoid giving the mistaken impression that Europe is responsible in the wrong area. We will also make sure we do not have a repeat at European level of the Lafontaine policy mix between monetary, financial and wage policy. I do not know what you meant by saying the European Central Bank should be involved here like the social partners and I hope I misunderstood you. The European Central Bank must play an entirely independent role and cannot be a component of a strategy put together by the governments.', 'Let me make a final remark. Mr Méndez de Vigo will have more to say about this. The institutional reform must be achieved in cooperation with the European Parliament, which must certainly have a better role to play at the intergovernmental conference than it did in Amsterdam, where it remained rather on the sidelines. I hope the German Presidency of the Council will manage to ensure that. We must make the European Union capable of enlargement by extending majority decision‐making. If in a second stage constitutional and other such questions are discussed, then it must be made clear that this will not delay the enlargement timetable. But we should keep these questions on the agenda and I can only congratulate you on the idea that we should formulate a strategy for drawing up a charter of basic rights. If that could be achieved in cooperation with the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it would do a great deal for the people and for the identity of the European Union.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MRS SCHLEICHER\\nVice‐President', 'Spaak (ELDR). – (FR) Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, during the 1998 congress in The Hague, the European Movement expressed its regret that the Union now seems condemned to progress in a vast conceptual vacuum and appears to lack any political perspective at a time when it is setting off on the two greatest adventures of its history: the launch of the single currency and enlargement.', 'Since 1998, another major challenge has appeared: the war in Kosovo. We must oppose all attacks on people\"s rights at the borders of Europe. But I must remind you that it is not the European idea that is at issue here. In his speech yesterday morning, Mr Prodi explained to us the fundamental values on which that is based. What is at issue, and what should be looked at seriously by the Cologne Council, is the fact that the political leaders of certain Member States have, for far too long now, tended to hang on to the outdated remains of their national sovereignty, particularly in terms of foreign policy.', 'The tragedy in Kosovo, which has been on the cards for almost ten years, is a terrible illustration of this. As a result, the European Parliament\"s compromise text stresses the importance of appointing the High Representative for the CFSP in Cologne. It also stresses that this High Representative must be supported by the policy planning and early warning unit and must also have the ability, through his or her personality, to play an important role.', 'The Liberal Group is particularly pleased that emphasis has been placed on the urgent need to strengthen institutional relations with the Western European Union, which should eventually have its own defence and prevention force.', 'I would now like to congratulate the chairman, Mr De Giovanni, on the text of his resolution, which, I am convinced, will serve as a reference point for the next Parliament. I must say that it was a great privilege to work with him.', 'To my mind, there are two key issues that should be considered in Cologne. The first of these is the timetable. The timetable approved by the Committee on Institutional Affairs puts emphasis on the conclusion of the work of the next IGC before the first enlargement. Only a requirement such as this will allow the applicant countries to embark on a political project, in full knowledge of the facts, where the acquis communautaire cannot be called into question.', 'The second issue is the method. The method used to prepare the ground for the Treaty of Amsterdam proved to have various weaknesses. We will therefore have to change our method. In other words, we will have to give the Commission the role it deserves, that of the driving force behind the next reform.', 'Mr Prodi\"s ambition in relation to the political authority he plans to exercise, along with his colleagues and the European Parliament, augurs well for the future; he is a committed European and we wish him every success. We would also like to thank Mr Santer for the work he has done during his time in office.', 'Cardona (UPE). – (PT) Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I have very carefully read and listened to the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr De Giovanni. I must take this opportunity to congratulate and thank him for his impartiality, conscientiousness and fairmindedness both in general and also as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, in which I have participated in recent years.', 'I wish to highlight a few of the most important aspects of this motion and the corresponding discussions. These relate to the idea which has prevailed and which still prevails of a European constitution, the establishment of or the desire to establish a specific constituent authority at Community level and a certain and perhaps corrective interpretation of the former Article N of the Treaty.', 'I have read, listened and reflected. I always taught my pupils that the law and politics must respond to the concerns of the people. At this point in time, it is apparent to me that the people of the European Union are concerned about war, misery, social exclusion, unemployment, drug trafficking and crime in general. As far as I have heard, they are not calling for a European constitution, unless they believe that a European constitution will solve everyone\"s problems. However, I do not share this belief. For me, a European constitution enshrining rights and duties which are not in themselves feasible and cannot be complied with is of little help with the problems currently on the minds of the people of Europe.', 'I also have my doubts about the European specific constituent authority. I too believe that the constituent authority comes from the people but I also believe and would argue at the moment that we do not have a European people. This does not mean, however, that this will not develop in the future and perhaps this should develop. Our borders are therefore not currently defined. So I consider, or I at least share the belief, that institutional reforms must be implemented. However, these must not assume the form of a constant building site. In particular, they must take account of the people, respond to their concerns and always include them. To conclude, if the people are not included, the building may collapse at any moment. And what I do not want to see, because I am a firm believer in Europe, is Europe collapsing due to any of these pitfalls.', 'Puerta (GUE/NGL). – (ES) Madam President, in the light of the structural unemployment in Europe, it is easy to understand the importance of the Cologne European Council. To govern is to make choices, and there are various choices available. My group feels that, given the choices set out in, for instance, the manifesto of the British and Spanish Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and José María Aznar, advocating further deregulation and greater flexibility, we would opt instead for a Franco‐Italian proposal, based on relaunching active employment policies and public investment.', 'The Cologne European Council must be more than just a combination of good intentions, a catalogue of unconnected actions or the sum of the national employment policies. The public would not accept this, nor would it be credible.', 'As far as the institutional timetable is concerned, we fully agree that institutional reform is now vital and that we must define the stages leading up to an intergovernmental conference. We can also tell the Council that Parliament has worked for many years to establish a genuine inventory of fundamental rights. We are in the best position to help.', 'As regards the war in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans, and particularly in Kosovo, we must state loudly and clearly that we totally condemn the activities of the Milosevic regime in Kosovo and that it is time to consider a political solution. In Yugoslavia or in Serbia, there are a million innocent people, a million good people who can help us stop the bombing, the widespread destruction of infrastructure and the collateral damage, and help us find a political solution in the wake of the punishment meted out not only to the Milosevic regime, but also to the population in general. The German Presidency should be particularly sensitive to this. I would never blame the German people for the sins of the regime it had to suffer under Hitler\"s dictatorship, and I feel that the same should apply in Yugoslavia. In this way, I hope that we can overcome the problems we face and come to an agreement on achieving peace for Europe.', 'Wolf (V). – (DE) Madam President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, as we have learned here in Parliament, in the alternation of presidencies what is important is not so much which country is in office or the abilities of its leading representatives as the underlying dynamic of the state of the Union. And I really must say at this solemn moment that there is great cause for concern here. Every person of sense now knows that the neo‐liberal counter‐reform has failed. And yet we go on here as though nothing had happened and at best we keep setting up new corporative consultation mechanisms. That is a good thing, but it is not the change of course that we need and without that change of course we will not satisfy the expectations of the peoples of Europe, who after all have been voting out the representatives of the neo‐liberal counter‐reform since 1995/96. Why do we not have the courage, the strength and the imagination to bring about this change of course? In this context, as a member of the Greens I particularly regret the resignation of my old friend Oskar Lafontaine.', 'Instead of seeing a clear change of course in European policy in year one of the euro and a move towards a new type of economic development that can also resolve the problem of mass unemployment, we are given a European employment pact that falls far short of what the Santer initiative once contained, that falls far short of what the original proposals that came from the presidency\"s German Ministry of Finance contained. It is not a question of whether the bottle is half full or half empty; it is a question of whether there will be a bottle at all or whether all that is fashioned in Cologne is a paper bottle that cannot be filled with anything. This is a fight we will now have to engage in, to ensure that we have a bottle that we can then fill. So I ask colleagues for their solidarity and openly welcome the European marches against mass unemployment which will bring these demands into the open again in Cologne; I hope that will help jolt the summit into action.', 'Dell\"Alba (ARE). – (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cologne summit has some very important work to do and also has the important task of appointing the High Representative for the CFSP.', 'From that perspective, it is unfortunate – and I am continuing to stress this point – that it is still being held on the dates it was originally planned for. If we had not had the crisis that shook the Commission, we would have found ourselves in a situation where, in spite of Parliament\"s requests, the European Council would have taken all the decisions without giving any consideration to the views of the voters who will be going to the polls between 10 and 13 June.', 'I have two requests to put to the Council. In relation to our foreign policy and our policy towards the United Nations, the European Union must make progress and speak out on two key issues: the ratification of the Statute of the permanent Criminal Court and the moratorium on capital executions, which was requested through a vote by the United Nations Commission in Geneva.', 'If the Union and the presidency were to highlight these two issues in the European Council to indicate the path to be followed and the choice to be made by the Union in the months ahead, we would be making a firm commitment in two areas which, in my view, will be critical as the third millennium approaches.', 'As far as institutional reform is concerned, I must thank Biagio De Giovanni, the chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, for his proposals. These are to be taken into account during the next parliamentary term and by the current and future presidency.', 'The Group of the European Radical Alliance added an amendment which I hope will be voted through so as to add an official and formal note to the European Parliament\"s right to ratify any proposal for reform. I hope that this amendment will be accepted during the vote, which is to be held shortly.', 'Berthu (I‐EDN). – (FR) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President‐in‐Office, the European Union is currently facing an institutional crisis following the collective resignation of the Commission. Yet the lesson the Council seems to want to draw from all this is that we should actually move towards more federalism, more of a superstate and more power for the Commission.', 'The Heads of State and Government have already sought to appoint a more political President of the Commission, who will be responsible for exploiting all the federalist opportunities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam. The President‐designate, Mr Romano Prodi, seems to have decided, in fact, to make this a very political role. In his speech yesterday, he spoke of his political responsibility, of the Commissioners\" ability to provide political direction, of his role of political guidance and of the need for him to take an important political initiative. In short, the nominated President of the Commission is already tending to take the position of a head of state, with an extra dose of ultra‐liberal and free trade attitudes that should worry even the traditional Liberals.', 'The European Parliament will naturally encourage this development of government, initially through the resolution it is undoubtedly about to adopt, which hopes to make the Commission the driving force behind institutional reforms. However, before taking any decisions, it would be wiser to wait for the second report by the Committee of Experts, which will no doubt give us an interesting insight into the workings of the institutions. The European Parliament has cautiously postponed the publication of this report until after the European elections.', 'The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations feels that the real lesson to be learned from all this is that we should restore the primacy of national democracies with a view to bringing Europe closer to the people. In this respect, the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament – which the Council has just approved – sends out a signal in the wrong direction. In our view, it is totally unacceptable for the Members of this House to be paid out of the Community budget rather than by their own countries. An elected representative must be paid by those he represents and no one else. Otherwise, we would be institutionalising a dangerous mechanism against the people; it would represent – if I may say so, Madam President – an insidious coup d\"état .', 'Muscardini (NI). – (IT) Madam President, the Treaty of Amsterdam, which can be dubbed the treaty of lost opportunity, only came into force a few days ago and already it needs to have chapters on the institutional issues not resolved in Amsterdam incorporated into it to complete it.', 'The European Council in Cologne must remedy these omissions and do the groundwork for the reform of the Commission, the extension of qualified majority voting and the reweighting of the votes within the Council.', 'We are against any solution which reduces the powers of the Commission. It must retain its independence and its power to make proposals. These are both indispensable conditions for the fulfilment of its autonomous functions, in the general interest of the European Union. The exercise of these prerogatives prevents the Commission from becoming a sort of Council secretariat and hence dwindling to a level inappropriate to the political role it ought to play. It would also be improper and inappropriate for that role to dwindle into a bureaucratic one, without taking account of the need to extend the principle of subsidiarity whenever the opportunity arises. But even if all these concerns were addressed in preparation for the summit of Heads of State and Government, that would not represent an adequate response to the gravity of the Kosovo crisis and would not make up for the notable absence of Europe from that particular trouble spot in the current affairs of the continent.', 'If it wants to be equal to the role it ought to be playing, Europe has got to make up its mind finally to endow itself with a means of determining its own common foreign and security policy. A signal along those lines must go out from Cologne. A decision must be taken to make a start on political union. Our determination to take that route must be made clear, and it must be made clear that the European Union is going to be an active player in international relations and in dealing with crises, because it intends to equip itself with all the instruments it needs to guarantee its sovereignty and autonomy.', 'We need a new Treaty now and, more importantly, we need to give the starting signal and define the exact ground to be covered, and these signals must come from Cologne, especially as, with the unfortunate experience of Kosovo, public opinion is proving more sensitive than before to the role Europe can play.', 'Another unresolved issue, which affects the Union\"s ability to take action, is the lack of a common economic policy. The single market is prey to tensions and repercussions. A strong employment policy linked to development requires a coherent economic policy. There must be a definite signal marking the start of an irreversible stage which will lead to the solution the Union needs to operate effectively. The real economy of our countries needs new impetus to expand. That impetus will not come from stock exchange indicators. At worst, they disproportionately swell the financial bubble which dominates real economies like an incubus. Here too Cologne must give the signal in order to define an economic policy which finally sets out the objectives to be achieved, such as a different relationship with the global market organisation, the relaunch of quality as the hallmark of the European product, and lower taxes on businesses. We must ensure that Amsterdam is remembered as an opportunity regained rather than lost.', 'Görlach (PSE). – (DE) Madam President, Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the statement by the President‐in‐Office of the Council about Cologne is, as always with presidencies of the Council – and especially the German Presidency – very ambitious. But it is not enough just to wish the presidency of the Council and the Council as a whole good luck in achieving the objectives of the Cologne summit. Parliament should also make it clear that we have our own ideas on the central subjects of that summit and that we want the intended measures to produce a successful outcome. So I want to concentrate on two points.', 'The first is the institutional reforms and the preparations for the intergovernmental conference. It will not surprise you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, if I do not take the same line as my colleague Mr Elmar Brok. If the institutions are to cooperate successfully but also if we are to secure what is eventually achieved in the intergovernmental conference for the long term and implement it successfully, then the European Parliament must be involved more closely in this conference than it was in past conferences – and I am deliberately not using the term intergovernmental conference, however much that has become common parlance – in this conference of the Member States. I know the will is there. And it is not just a matter of form either, nor of our wish for recognition. It is simply a question of normal procedures among democratic institutions of which more account should be taken in future.', 'When you discuss the institutional reforms do remember that it is not just a question of figures but also of ensuring that the matter of Parliament\"s lack of power in relation to cooperation with the Council and the Commission – here I am addressing the inadequate codecision procedures – really is included in the agenda of this conference. In addressing this, I am also addressing in very concrete terms an area which greatly concerns this Parliament, the Council and the Commission and which continues to account for nearly half the entire EU budget. I am referring specifically to the common agricultural policy. We cannot accept that Parliament has no codecision right in this sector that accounts for half the budget. We really must fill this democratic gap. That is a most important point!', 'My second point concerns the common foreign and security policy. We urgently need it. It is clear to see and everybody will understand that Parliament is not very happy with the creation of a Mr or Mrs CFSP because this does not really fit into the kind of structures we have all built up in our Member States. But I do not want to quarrel about that now. I would like to see progress made in the common foreign and security policy. And that is also the view of my group. So we say: ‘OK, do it, and do it quickly!\" For sadly there is a bitter lesson we have had to learn: one cause of all that has already happened in the Balkans and that is also happening now lies in the absence of a really effective EU common foreign and security policy.', '(Applaus)', 'Méndez de Vigo (PPE). – (ES) Mr President‐in‐Office, in the speech by President Santer – which was an excellent speech and I would like to congratulate him on it – and the speeches by my other colleagues in the House, you will find a rare unanimity. Parliament is in favour of institutional reform and supports the presidency in its efforts to that end. We need it for the simple reason that it was not tackled in Amsterdam. We also need it because Parliament is in favour of enlargement and we do not want enlargement to be delayed any further because the institutions have not been reformed. We are therefore going to support all the initiatives the German Presidency takes to implement this reform as soon as possible.', 'My colleague Mr Brok has already spoken about the content and I would like to speak about the method. I believe that, through the resolution last November which Mr De Giovanni mentioned, Parliament proposed something that is as original as it is simple: the idea of using the Community method, the method we are accustomed to, in order to prepare the reform of the institutions.', 'We certainly do not wish to take the place of the governments, who will have to take the decisions. What we want to do is to help make things easier for them. So, with the approval in due course of President Santer – for which I would like to pay tribute to him – we believe that one good possibility would be for the European Commission to prepare a draft, to discuss it with Parliament and to also include the national parliaments in the discussion – for a discussion is all it would be. Eventually, we would be able to present the governments with a proposal, which we hope would receive as much support as possible.', 'In my view, if the Commission is in agreement, if the European Parliament is in agreement and if the national parliaments have been involved, this document would have tremendous legitimacy, and the governments and any President‐in‐Office would be able to accept a discussion paper. I would point out once again that you would have the last word.', 'I think that this is a good possibility, Mr President‐in‐Office, and I would ask you to give it your consideration in Cologne.', 'IN THE CHAIR: Mr G. COLLINS\\nVice‐President', 'Elmalan (GUE/NGL). – (FR) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, you told us, Mr Santer, that Cologne would be interesting from an employment point of view and that we would be another step closer to the European Employment Pact. This is what we hope to see. When it was announced, our group welcomed the new approach set out in Luxembourg and in Pörtschach. These summits were actually marked by a change of tone and confirmed that our priority was the fight against unemployment. However, our hopes were not to be fulfilled with the subsequent Vienna summit. We had to content ourselves with statements; no specific measures were adopted.', 'We hope that the Cologne summit will come up to the expectations of the people of Europe and will result in specific actions. In light of the preparatory work, we are hopeful, since certain governments are proposing active employment policies and measures to relaunch investment. However, the statements by Mr Prodi and other governments, which advocate competition, liberalisation, and the flexibility of work, are also casting a shadow over this hope.', 'As the Secretary‐General of the ESC recently pointed out, we must do away with a certain dogmatism and use stability to foster growth and employment. Our group is putting forward innovative proposals to support this growth and generate employment. We propose to replace the stability pact with a genuine growth pact. Its main priorities would be to relaunch profitable investment, to continue lowering interest rates selectively to promote employment, to work to reduce working hours without cutting wages, to put a stop to the process of liberalisation and deregulation, and to establish a minimum wage in every Member State.', 'The German Presidency has rightly emphasised fiscal policy and its interaction with our economic and budget policies. In this area too, we must be innovative by combating fiscal dumping and taxing financial transactions. The social movement is becoming increasingly important at European level, and together with this movement we will work to ensure that these proposals contribute to a social and democratic Europe.', 'Voggenhuber (V). – (DE) Mr President, NATO\"s war against Yugoslavia has failed in its declared objective. It has not managed to put an end to the crimes against the people of Kosovo but instead has dramatically worsened their plight. But this failed NATO objective, the humanitarian crisis, was the only justification for violating international law and conducting this war of aggression. No end justifies the means. That realisation is one of the foundations of our civilisation. The ultima ratio has proved irrational. All those who do not now restore the rule of law and end this war bear responsibility for the terrible violence, for the civilian victims, for the destruction of the basic means of livelihood and civilian infrastructure in Serbia, for the use of forbidden weapons.', 'Swoboda (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I want to address two points: employment policy and the announced intergovernmental conference.', 'Let me first take this opportunity to thank both the President‐in‐Office of the Council and the President of the Commission for constantly bringing up and resolutely following up the question of employment policy, even though the Santer plan was not followed up to the same extent and came to nought in the Council.', 'So I welcome the proposal once again to conclude a European employment pact in Cologne, especially after the preliminary discussions during the Austrian Presidency. For I think it would be very dangerous if the grave crises of today – such as Kosovo – led us to forget that we have a social crisis within the European Union. The President‐in‐Office of the Council rightly said that unemployment is the most urgent social problem of our time. I was painfully aware that the candidate for the presidency of the EU Commission failed to address this problem in equally clear and unambiguous terms yesterday.', 'Let me also emphasise strongly that we need closer cooperation between the European countries and between monetary, financial and wage policy. It is an illusion to think – and I do not think anyone would pretend it was possible – that national or regional employment policy could be replaced by an EU‐wide policy. What approach the European Central Bank takes, what kind of interest‐rate and monetary policy it formulates, what kind of infrastructure is built up, whether it would not finally be possible to strengthen the European infrastructure in particular, all these things have a major impact on competitiveness, on unemployment and on the employment situation in Europe. In my view we must not desist here but must make greater efforts to coordinate these policies.', 'Let me make a brief comment on the second point, the intergovernmental conference. I want to say quite openly and plainly that I am sceptical about the notion that the European Union can be reformed simply by holding a kind of intergovernmental conference. What the President‐in‐Office of the Council said here today in fact backs up this scepticism, for he said that far more comprehensive reforms will have to be undertaken. But can the representatives of governments whose powers, means of action and influence are being taken away and transferred to the European level put together a genuine reform package by themselves? After all Amsterdam did not just fail because of the ill will of individuals, it also failed for structural reasons, because of the way these matters are approached. I believe we need a parliamentary constituent assembly in which this Parliament and the national parliaments cooperate at least as equal partners, as a complement to the intergovernmental conference, otherwise we will end up with another failed intergovernmental conference. I think it is essential also to involve this Parliament more closely in this process.', 'Maij‐Weggen (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, holding a European summit so soon before the European elections brings both dangers and opportunities. The biggest danger is that once again not one important decision will be taken and the people of Europe will turn away in despair from the spectacle of European cooperation within Europe, which is all too frequently hesitant and deficient. The biggest opportunity is that a number of issues will be resolved and confidence in European cooperation restored and strengthened.', 'A breakthrough would be both useful and necessary on three points. The common defence and foreign policy has always been a non‐starter, partly because a number of Member States have sought to retain primacy. The drama in Kosovo and the moral and military response to it have brought the Union together for the first time in this field. It would bring us nothing but credit if we could sustain this unity and defend this European cooperation on the basis of values such as democracy and human and minority rights. I would strongly urge the Council to do this. It is also just as urgent to get rid of the destructive unanimity requirement in the Council.', 'A second step forward should be to establish better standards and values for a social Europe. We want a Europe which not only embraces economic and monetary cooperation but which is also concerned about unemployment, combating poverty and caring for the disabled and the elderly. In short, a Europe that seeks not only to earn money but also to be of service to a society in which humane standards carry weight.', 'A third breakthrough is necessary in the field of the internal democracy and transparency of the European institutions. After the European summit in Cologne we must choose once and for all to have a Europe in which the European Parliament exercises control over all legislation and the entire budget and in which the European Commission is required to guarantee maximum transparency and management which is free from fraud. The loopholes in the Treaty of Amsterdam in this field must be closed as soon as possible. That is the kind of Europe we want, Mr President, a safe, social and democratic Europe which is free from fraud. If the Cologne summit can provide an impetus for this then as far as I am concerned it will have been a success.', 'Myller (PSE). – (FI) Mr President, Mr President‐designate of the Commission, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, employment issues have been accorded the importance they deserve in European Union policy, and at the Cologne summit Germany will be making efforts to push through the European employment agreement. In this regard the Amsterdam Treaty articles concerning employment can be said to be gaining substance. In pushing through the European strategy on employment it is vital to get to grips with measures that can provide added value for national efforts. It is especially important to ensure that Europe is competitive while still complying with agreements that have been made. The superiority of European labour market practice must be made plainly visible through our ability to maintain growth and levels of employment by means of a system of open dialogue among the labour market organisations.', 'The people of Europe have been concerned, alarmed and puzzled that another war seems to be developing in the Balkans, where small children and the elderly are the ones who are suffering. The Cologne summit must succeed in creating a credible single foreign and security policy. High level representation alone is not enough; adequate tools for action are needed.', 'The European Union must take more overall responsibility in order to ensure that the situation in the Balkans grows more stable and allows different groups to coexist. We must also immediately embark on an active programme of cooperation with Russia, just as Germany, as holder of the presidency, has done to its credit. The present and future holders of the presidency must create an agenda for advancing the strategy on Russia. One important ingredient in this programme is the approval and practical application of the recommended measures to be taken within the context of the northern dimension.', 'Tindemans (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to devote my last speech in the European Parliament to the common foreign and security policy. EU enlargement and the events in central Europe oblige us to make a realistic assessment of the possibilities that such a policy offers. There is clearly movement within the European Union: Pörtschach, Saint Malo, Bremen, Berlin. Cologne could be a historic summit. Both Chancellor Schröder and Minister Verheugen have made optimistic statements.', 'There is a new awareness of the principles which must form the basis of global policy. Europe must now determine its future responsibilities. The principle of equal partnership with the United States must be better defined. Strategies must be agreed. There is a lot that can be decided now, without having to amend the Treaties. A different timetable must be adopted than the one proposed by the Committee on Institutional Affairs. The Western European Union should be fully integrated into the European Union in 2002, for example. In the meantime, someone can already be appointed to be responsible for the common foreign and security policy, together with his or her deputy. The Defence Ministers must be granted a responsible role, and we must determine the proper role for the Political Committee. We must make it easier to increase cooperation in the field of foreign policy and security. Self‐planning and analysis can start immediately. In the light of Pörtschach it is very important to determine exactly what the ‘European pillar\" involves.', 'It is now time to give real substance to the European defence identity. My hope is that the European Council will understand what is now at stake and make Cologne a success.', 'Schäfer (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very good thing that the German Presidency is to give the starting signal for another intergovernmental conference at the EU summit in Cologne. We must make progress with the democratisation of the EU. The core elements of this are as follows: majority voting as the rule, a new weighting of votes in the Council, structural changes in the Commission and the European Parliament\"s right of assent on all treaty changes. The distinction between compulsory and non‐compulsory expenditure could also be done away with. But if our end is to be democratisation, it must also be the means. That is why we have to apply the Community method to future reforms, which means that the Commission must make the first proposals; it is essential, I repeat essential, for the European Parliament to be distinctly more involved!', 'With the Amsterdam Treaty, Agenda 2000 and the euro, the EU has acquired a new quality; with the military operations in Kosovo its face has changed. All this also brings us up against the question of the constitution we now have and the constitution that we need. It is clear that however much we appreciate the presidents and grandees who presided over the beginning of European integration and the Community treaties, today we must give priority to basic rights and declare confidently that we, the citizens of Europe, are building a Europe of freedom, peace and solidarity. Human dignity, justice and the social welfare state are both the means and the end. The Biagio De Giovanni resolution sets out a guideline for the years to come. The German Government deserves our support for its commitment.', 'Bianco (PPE). – (IT) Mr President, the next few years will determine the new strategy, the new shape of the map of Europe.', 'The question is whether we succeed in having a policy which includes the whole continent or whether, through possibly unenlightened choices, we stir up old divisions, create new clashes and open up a kind of trench across the heart of Europe.', 'Mr President, the Balkan question must be dealt with, that is certain. But to do that it is vital to get Russia firmly involved in the right way. Finally that has been understood. We ourselves cannot settle these sorts of separation issues. The response must be loud and clear. I support the programme you have presented: the European constitution and the new Charter that it must include. The problems of unemployment must be confronted with renewed vigour.', 'I think it is very important that we have spoken with one voice. It is vital for European policy that we speak with one voice. But we also need to speak with the right voice. And the right voice cannot be just the voice of war, it must be a diplomatic voice and a political voice too, capable of finding the space to resolve the problems.', 'We are not at war with Serbia, but we are trying to make Serbia respect fundamental human rights, and we need to be able to take advantage of every means available to us. There is an opening at the moment. The European Union must keep talking and move things even further forward.', 'Mr President, I support the proposal for peace and stability. Its aims coincide with our established position. I want to thank President Santer because, if Parliament is to grow strong, it must also be responsible. Too much presumption can sometimes lead to conflicts which cause imbalances. That is why we need a European constitution and that is why we need a high level response, which should come from the Cologne summit.', 'Barros Moura (PSE). – (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my feeling is that, in addition to enlargement, the European Union is now needs to give specific political responses to a series of problems on which our future really depends. These responses must be understood by the people or, to put it another way, they must be ‘user‐friendly\" for the men and women of Europe. At the top of the list is the need for effective coordination of economic policies and for an employment pact. This requires the political will to use the opportunities created by the euro for this purpose. We need a security and justice policy which meets the expectations and requirements to defend the freedoms of the people. In particular, in view of the Balkan issue, we clearly need, but are genuinely lacking, a common foreign and security policy.', 'I agree with those who have said that if the political will existed, the current Treaties could allow us to achieve a great deal. The political will to use the current Treaties in this way has been lacking and I fear that when the ‘cold war\" ends, there are some who may lose the desire for political integration which is at the root of our achievements and of peace in Europe.', 'I congratulate the German Presidency of the Council for its decision to hold the Intergovernmental Conference although it may find that this should take place using a Community procedure. The institutional reforms or the desire to limit the IGC to the three reforms from Amsterdam, including the weighting of votes and the number of Commissioners, are restrictive. I fear that this is hiding the idea of a return to an intergovernmental Europe with a ‘governing body\" consisting of the large Member States. I am saying this straight out as I feel that this is the essence of many speeches. I believe that if we can bring to the fore the idea of a constitutional and citizenship pact, this must primarily imply a reinforced political will for political integration to overcome nationalism. Note that I am saying this at a time when war has reignited in the Balkans. Our way forward must be through integration because, as Mitterrand said here in this House, ‘nationalism is war\".', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to this debate, which I regard as on the whole giving strong encouragement to the German Presidency\"s programme for the Cologne summit which I have presented. Let me very briefly give my position on four questions that many Members have raised here.', 'The first is the question of the basic perspective, the basic strategy. Quite contrary to some fears expressed here, it would seem that Europe is coming closer together in face of the crisis and that the processes of integration are acquiring a new dynamic, both internally and in terms of the area covered, quite simply because, as I have said once before in this Parliament, the European alternatives are becoming clearer than ever before in this time of crisis, namely the alternative represented by this Parliament, which is an integrated Europe, a Europe based on peace, stability and prosperity, and on the other side the old picture of Europe that we see in the Balkan wars: nationalism resulting in war, expulsion and misery. When we look at these alternatives we see that there is a very distinct trend throughout Europe towards European integration. We must exploit and strengthen that trend. Let me give a small example. The fact that last week the Council called on the Commission urgently to submit a proposal to conclude association negotiations with Albania and Macedonia means that we are actually 10 to 20 years ahead of time, for under normal circumstances this could not have been envisaged until at least ten years\" hence. It is the political circumstances that are forcing us to rethink our strategy and really make use of the dynamic that has now been created.', 'The second question concerns the Employment Pact. Let me say that in terms of substance it is not an employment policy action plan. That remains within the remit of the responsible national leaders. The Federal Republic of Germany, for instance, has already submitted its national plan and is trying to implement it; it has earmarked DM 2 billion for a special plan to create 100 000 training places and jobs for unemployed young people. That is what we expect of the Member States. What the European Employment Pact can achieve is a commitment to ends and also to means, and above all macro‐economic coordination. We should not underestimate the importance of that coordination, for it did not work adequately in the past. In this context, the macro‐economic dialogue between the institutions on the one hand and with the social partners and the European Central Bank on the other represents a new and important element. It is not a question of in any way diminishing the Central Bank\"s independence, but it obviously must be included in any dialogue on macro‐economic coordination. After all, it has very crucial instruments available to it and surely it is better for people to sit down together and talk to each other – and the European Central Bank can evaluate the real expectations in Europe – than to engage in public quarrels and battles that cannot produce any practical results.', 'My second point in this connection is that of course we must optimise the financial resources and instruments available to the European Union and in particular to the Commission with a view to creating employment. As I understood President Santer, the report he intends to submit is aimed at achieving precisely that objective.', 'My third point concerns the institutional reforms. I would not like to see any misunderstanding arise here. What the German Presidency is envisaging is the beginning of a medium and long‐term process whose end we cannot even foresee, just as we cannot even foresee its scale. Embedded within this process are concrete steps that we can see clearly and that we should take as soon as possible, rather than embarking on some huge reform project that encompasses everything, an intergovernmental conference on a scale never seen before; that would lead to the kind of failure never seen before either. The rational course is to decide step by step what can be decided, while always remembering that we are engaged in a more broadly‐based process that will basically be a process of social discussion, a process of parliamentary discussion.', 'The first two steps are, therefore, as I have said: firstly, to tackle the famous leftovers of Amsterdam and examine the question whether our present situation as regards relations between the institutions will force us to make further changes to the Treaty, and secondly, the charter of basic rights, which, as I said, will have to be formulated by the parliaments.', 'My last point goes back to what Mr Tindemans and others have said. I am extremely grateful to Mr Tindemans for speaking so plainly, for his urgent appeal that we finally do what we should have done long ago. The German Presidency has undertaken to do a great deal here. It wants Europe to do more than just speak, but to act, to take a real leap forward now, to actually use the instruments at our disposal, for in the end they are all there. They are all there in the Amsterdam Treaty. They are all there in the various institutions concerned with security in Europe. We just have to put it all together and fashion it into a meaningful whole. It is a question of political will and nothing else. It is not a question of not having the necessary means or legal bases. It is simply a question of political will. I cannot foresee today whether the Heads of State and Government will muster this strong political will to take the necessary step and open up the new dimension of integration that we urgently need. But I promise you that we will make every effort to achieve this. And all in all I am optimistic, because the situation we now find ourselves in truly does force us to draw the conclusions that should have been drawn a long time ago.', 'President . – I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) and Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure on the European Council meeting in Cologne and the oral questions on institutional reform.(2)', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.']}, {'topic': '4.

Parliament\"s services have informed us that this joint debate on Agenda 2000 will begin with statements by the Council and the Commission, which will then be followed first by the speeches by the groups rather than the speeches by the rapporteurs. I would like to know if this is correct, and if so, can you tell me on what basis this decision was taken, as it is a totally abnormal procedure? In fact, in my 14 years in this House, I cannot remember a time when the groups spoke before the rapporteurs on any budget report. I would like to know if my information is correct and what procedure we are going to follow.', 'President . – The decision on this matter was taken at the Conference of Presidents and it is binding on us so we will proceed.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin Agenda 2000 package, which accounts for a volume of more than EUR 680 billion, probably contains the most comprehensive reform of EU policies in the history of the Union. It includes a solid financial framework up to the year 2006, substantial reforms to the common agricultural policy and to structural policy, as well as changes to the own resources decision that take greater account of the Member States\" financial situation and help distribute the burden more fairly.', 'Agenda 2000 was concluded in accordance with the timetable fixed by the European Council in Cardiff, which demonstrated that the European Union is able to act under increasingly difficult conditions. This prompt agreement paves the way to enlargement eastward. It is also an important precondition for the seamless continuation of structural policy as from 1 January 2000. Let me briefly repeat the key elements of the reform. On the common agricultural policy: the Berlin package contains the widest‐reaching reform ever of the common agricultural policy. The gradual approximation of support prices to the world market price level, flanked by direct payments, prepares our undertakings for the further liberalisation of world trade that is taking place now. Among the key elements of the reform package are the further development of the rural development policy, including improved support for environmentally compatible farming methods.', 'On structural policy: the distinct tightening up of structural policy through internal concentration, which means fewer objectives and fewer Community initiatives, and through concentrating the range of supports will increase efficiency. The structural resources will be concentrated on the genuinely needy regions, especially by giving clear priority to Objective 1 regions and by continuing the Cohesion Fund. An additional priority will be to combat unemployment. To that end, the Objective 3 funds, intended to support employment measures, will be increased substantially. For the years 2000 to 2006, a total of EUR 24 billion will be made available.', 'On the financing system: the European Council has recognised that there are still budgetary imbalances in the financing of the Union and has provided for changes to the existing own resources system in order to take more account of the Member States\" ability to pay and thus make their contributions fairer. In the Council\"s view, it is particularly important that in spite of these comprehensive reforms it proved possible to stabilise expenditure. The ceiling of EU expenditure remains 1.27\\u2009% of the European Union\"s gross national product, and we will continue to remain below this ceiling.', 'In the year 2006, expenditure will account for 1.13\\u2009% of the EU\"s gross national product. That is equivalent to the 1999 value. The resources allocated to enlargement up to the year 2006 are included in this figure, in this 1.13\\u2009%. The expenditure for the EU of 15 members is to be EUR 686 billion up to 2006 and will be kept constant in real terms, which means that for the first time we will now also be achieving at European level what the Member States have already achieved, namely strict budgetary discipline, strict expenditure discipline and keeping budgetary increases in line with economic requirements.', 'In real terms, agricultural expenditure will be restricted to an average of EUR 40.5 billion a year for market measures plus about EUR 13 billion for rural development over the period 2000 to 2006. That means that agricultural expenditure will be stabilised at the 1999 level. The Agenda 2000 reform package represents a major step towards enlargement. In agricultural policy, by placing more emphasis on the world market and the environment, we will now be giving agriculture in the accession countries a good basis for agricultural policy planning. That will make it easier for them to integrate in the European single market.', 'A sum of about EUR 22 billion is being made available for pre‐accession aid, together with a further EUR 58 billion for enlargement‐related expenditure, which means that over the financing period a total of EUR 80 billion is available for enlargement, although it can only be spent if enlargement actually takes place. These resources cannot be transferred for other purposes.', 'As regards financial precautions, as I have already pointed out we are still below the own resources ceiling, which means we have a quite considerable financial margin of 0.14\\u2009% of the EU gross national product to provide for unforeseen expenditure. What is crucial now is for the political decisions to be implemented rapidly by the adoption of the necessary legal acts, i.e. the prompt conclusion of the legislative procedure.', 'I want to stress that we are all responsible for the success of this historic reform package. It is now up to the European Parliament to decide on Agenda 2000. Let me point out that the conciliation procedure agreed between the Austrian Presidency and Parliament has proved to be extremely successful and useful. Parliament was kept fully informed on a regular basis of the progress of work on Agenda 2000 and the Commission and the Council took account of Parliament\"s views in their deliberations. There was not just an exchange of ideas but a genuine process of mutual influence, which I felt was extremely important and which also went a very long way to meet Parliament\"s view of itself as an institution with a genuine say.', 'So I am confident that the European Parliament will take a responsible approach in exercising its rights to participate in the decisions on the regulations on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Let me point out again that the presidency has made considerable efforts to achieve a result that pleases and satisfies all parties concerned, not just Parliament but the Member States too. If you will allow me, I will make a personal comment now – after all this is probably also my last appearance in the European Parliament. It is interesting to note that an agenda such as Agenda 2000 is of course also a fight between the Member States for the money available for distribution. Indeed a very large sum of money has to be distributed. That is why it was not really surprising to find that prior to the Cologne summit there was criticism from various sides about the presidency\"s strategy, about the way the negotiations were conducted; but since the Berlin summit, the situation has been assessed quite differently.', 'All the European capitals have voiced unanimous praise and agreement, which shows that we have achieved what we wanted to achieve. Nobody won in Berlin, and nobody lost either. Everyone made their contribution to the compromise and everyone gained something from this compromise. In that respect I think I am entitled to say that it was a successful summit.', 'I would like to thank all the committee members, the chairmen of the committees involved and Parliament\"s rapporteurs for their good cooperation over the past months. I do not think I need at this point give a detailed list of the many amendments proposed by Parliament and which the Council accepted. You know all that.', 'But I would like to mention the most recent example of the Council\"s willingness to compromise with Parliament, namely the fact that the URBAN Community initiative is now being continued thanks to Parliament\"s pressure. We also managed to find a compromise solution on the question of the financing of URBAN. Moreover, the Council stated that it was prepared to negotiate at a given time about making up to EUR 200 million available from the budget\"s flexibility reserve to offset the cost of innovative measures. That is a good example of the successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament.', 'I also had a strong personal commitment to the success of this agenda, which is why I appeal to you to approve the package before you. I believe that both sides, the Council and Parliament, have done as much as they could. There are still some wishes that have not been satisfied, nobody disputes that. We, I, the presidency, still have some wishes that were not satisfied. But we must never forget that this kind of negotiated result simply represents what 15 Member States can do together at a given time, and given that we were 15, we could do no more. We could perhaps have achieved more had we been 14, or 13 or 12, but not with 15 Member States. What we have before us is what the 15 can achieve at this point in time. Parliament can do more, I know that, but when you take your decision please do not forget that the Member States are firmly convinced that they have reached the limits of what they can do.', 'It is also necessary in the interest of the people, of the citizens of Europe, for the necessary regulations to be adopted and for there to be no delays. Many European regions have to adjust to the changes resulting from Agenda 2000. We should not ask them to accept a period of insecurity and uncertainty. Thank you for your attention!', '(Applaus)', 'Wulf‐Mathies, Commission. – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 is being adopted against the background of the Kosovo crisis. Nothing could make it clearer how important it is to safeguard and deepen European integration. As European history has shown, it takes far more than the absence of war for societies to develop peacefully in the long term. Democracy, respect for human rights, tolerance, security and economic and social stability form the basis of the success of the EU and the personal welfare of each individual.', 'The humanitarian disaster in Kosovo makes enlargement eastward and the democratic and economic stabilisation of the Balkans even more urgent, in the interests not only of the people in Central and Eastern Europe but also of our own security. Against this background, we cannot overestimate the importance of financially safeguarding the enlargement process through Agenda 2000 and of the positive signal the Community is thereby giving the states applying for accession. But we must do more than this, which is why it is right and necessary that over and above Agenda 2000 the Council has also declared itself willing to cover the additional resources needed for the Balkans by, if necessary, reviewing the financial perspective.', 'So far Europe has been able to develop a social system that broadly guarantees democracy, cultural diversity, competitiveness and solidarity. The various pillars – the single market, economic and monetary union and promoting economic and social cohesion – have helped achieve that. Agenda 2000 safeguards these pillars and allows us to further develop the European system for the future.', 'The adoption by the European Parliament of Agenda 2000 will conclude a two‐year process of intensive discussions and negotiations. By in a sense anticipating Amsterdam, if I may put it that way, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament have proved through a process of increasingly close coordination and positive give and take that it is possible to achieve results that will help the EU as a whole to make progress. It makes no difference that this is a genuine compromise, meaning that not everyone could obtain all they wanted, and that it is a compromise that produces more satisfactory results in some areas than in others.', 'Let me thank the presidencies involved, and in particular the presidency of the Council and Chancellor Schröder, for the fact that they managed, by persevering with the negotiations, to bring about agreement between the Member States. That was a success for Europe during a difficult time. And let me thank Parliament not just for the numerous improvements to the original proposals but above all for its constructive approach and the great flexibility it displayed, which made it possible to reach agreement so quickly.', 'I have already said that not everything has been resolved in an equally satisfactory manner. Mr Fischler will talk about this in detail later in relation to agricultural policy. The Commission regrets that it did not prove possible in Berlin to adopt at least those reforms that the agriculture ministers had already decided. The watering down of the reforms in the cereals and milk sector raises a number of questions. The review clause in the cereals sector shows that the Heads of State and Government have not even excluded the possibility, perhaps indeed the necessity, of further improvements.', 'With the postponement of the milk reform to the end of the 2000‐2006 period, the costs of the reform were merely postponed to the next financing period, without removing the market imbalances. But one positive aspect I would like to emphasise is that the Council has adopted the Commission\"s proposals on the second pillar, on the consolidation of rural development policy, almost unchanged. That not only underpins sustainable development in the rural regions but also gives the European Parliament a new power of codecision on agricultural matters, for in future this expenditure will be shown as non‐compulsory. So that too satisfies a major demand by Parliament. The division of the traditional agricultural guideline into two sub‐headings that this calls for will in fact require stricter budgetary discipline in the organisations of the markets. But overall, the agricultural reform is an important step towards a competitive agriculture in Europe.', 'The second major pillar of Agenda 2000 is the reform of regional and cohesion policy. It is a sign of the close cooperation between all concerned that this reform strengthens the policy of social and economic cohesion in the European Union.', 'Even if the financial resources for the next funding period remain a little below what the Commission originally proposed, one major success is that the level of Community solidarity with the poorest and structurally weakest regions of the Union is being maintained without any cutbacks and that the Cohesion Fund is being continued. In this context I think it is important to point out that the Structural Funds, with their declining expenditure profile, make an important contribution to consolidating the budget, although Community solidarity with the structurally weakest regions remains fixed at the highest level of the last funding period, namely at the level of 1999. That was only possible because this time the principle of concentration really could be applied successfully. The structurally weakest Objective 1 regions will receive not just two thirds but this time as much as 70\\u2009% of all Structural Funds resources.', 'The criteria relating to eligibility for aid and to the level of that aid are not just objective and transparent, they are also being observed strictly and without exception and I believe that is an important point which will also be significant for the future.', 'In regard to implementation and management, we will in future look to decentralisation, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities, building up partnership at all levels and substantially improving monitoring, control and evaluation. Since the European Court of Auditors and Parliament\"s Committee on Budgets have taken a very positive view of these aspects of the Commission\"s proposal, I am confident that this has created the conditions for better control in future than in the past by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors of the financial settlement and efficiency of the resources allocated.', 'But above all, the principle of concentration means concentration on the Union\"s political priorities. So all the Structural Funds will now concentrate on creating secure jobs for the future, which means employment‐intensive growth, strengthening the competitiveness and innovative power of the regions, sustainable development and promoting skills and equal opportunities. That applies in particular to the European Social Fund, which Mr Flynn will be discussing in more detail later on.', 'As an instrument of labour market policy and of the development of human resources, it will also form the core of the European employment strategy, an active labour market policy. Equal access to the employment market for all, lifelong learning, the adaptability of workers and undertakings and positive actions in favour of women are key elements here. We cannot have an effective structural policy unless we establish closer partnership. Here the Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament and I am sure that Parliament will ensure in future too that adequate attention is paid to this in the everyday implementation of the Structural Funds reform.', 'Partnership between the Commission and Parliament also includes the code of conduct that we have agreed. Parliament has also succeeded in its call for all the structural measures for fisheries to be brought together under Category 2 and for unified horizontal planning. At the last minute, as Mr Verheugen pointed out, it even proved possible to strengthen the urban dimension of the Structural Funds through the fourth Community initiative, URBAN, called for by Parliament.', 'Agenda 2000 is also the necessary condition for the enlargement process. With its pre‐accession aid and the gradual inclusion of the Central and Eastern European countries, the agenda is mobilising a package of EUR 80 billion for economic development in Central and Eastern Europe. Here it is drawing on proven instruments to reduce infrastructure weaknesses in transport and the environment and it will try to ensure that these instruments are effectively linked to the existing PHARE and Interreg instruments.', 'It is important to the implementation of the Agenda 2000 package for the new interinstitutional agreement to establish a solid, seven‐year financial framework. Agreement was reached on the following points during the negotiations. By limiting expenditure, the EU is contributing to budgetary consolidation on a Europe‐wide basis. At the same time, the financing of Community policy is guaranteed in the medium term.', 'Moreover, the financial distribution system is fairer. I know that not all Members are convinced of the merits of the proposed interinstitutional agreement. That is why I would stress that it is also in Parliament\"s interest that the implementation of Agenda 2000 is not jeopardised by annual budgetary conflicts. Mr Liikanen will be confirming this when he gives his views later.', 'At any rate the Commission believes that it is very much thanks to the European Parliament that the necessary budgetary discipline will not create a burden for the poorest members of the Community, that at the same time this expenditure discipline enables us to tie up an important enlargement package and that we have achieved additional margins for manoeuvre in internal policy areas and in regard to administrative tasks, which will enable us on the one hand to underpin the emerging economic and employment upswing and on the other to put the administration in a position really to shoulder the additional new tasks. In light of the debates we have had here in past months, I believe that is an important common aim.', 'The Agenda 2000 reforms encompass EU policy areas that directly concern the people of Europe. These proposals open up new personal prospects for many people. It is your privilege, by the adoption of the legislative proposals on Agenda 2000, to lay an important foundation stone not just for fulfilling the expectations of our people but also for the Europe of the future. That is why I hope they will find broad support and on behalf of the entire Commission let me say that I am grateful for the excellent cooperation with the European Parliament on the Agenda 2000 package.', '(Applaus)', 'President . – Thank you Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies.', 'The debate will be resumed at 3 p.m. this afternoon.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR GIL‐ROBLES\\nPresident', 'President . – Mr Skinner has the floor on a point of order.', \"Skinner (PSE). – Mr President, yesterday the Council's representatives agreed to an effective ban across the European Union on white asbestos and yet there are some concerns that there will be unnecessary delays in the signature of this particular document, which Parliament has played a very positive role in bringing to the fore.

Having said that, I am completely in favour of a statute for Members of the European Parliament and believe that it should be introduced as soon as possible, but not by means of a violation of Parliament\"s procedures and of our Rules of Procedure.', '(Applaus)', 'President . – Yes, Mr Fayot, we have examined these amendments very carefully. They do not replace the text in its entirety, but only part of the text.', '(Mixed reactions)', 'That is why, after consulting the services responsible, we decided that they were admissible. Moreover, the Legal Affairs Committee, which had some doubts, held a vote in a very similar case on one of the proposed texts, which was rejected.', 'Rothley (PSE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, I agree with Mr Fayot: it is irresponsible to adopt a text for a statute that could not be examined in the committees!', '(Applaus)', 'I also want to raise another point of order. I have the official voting list at hand. I see that on paragraph 1 you want to begin with Amendment No 2. Let me point out that my group tabled an Amendment No 27 to delete paragraph 1. There can hardly be an amendment that departs further from the text than one that deletes a paragraph. So I would ask you to begin by voting on Amendment No 27.', '(Applaus)', 'President . – Mr Rothley, although the services responsible inform me that the other amendments depart further from the text, I agree with you that an amendment seeking to delete a paragraph is always the one that departs furthest from the text. So everyone will naturally know what they will have to vote on later. This is not a matter of judging votes in advance; we are trying to comply with the Rules of Procedure. And in my view, an amendment that seeks to delete a paragraph always departs further from the text than an amendment that seeks to replace it. As a result, as the rapporteur said, we will vote firstly on Amendment No 27, which seeks to delete the paragraph from the rapporteur\"s resolution. I am very sorry, but I must comply with the Rules. We are therefore going to begin with the vote on Amendment No 27. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very long vote ahead of us and we must get through it peacefully. We are not going to open a debate on the Rules now. Once again, I am sorry, but we must proceed with the vote.', 'Martinez (NI). – (FR) Mr President, I would simply like to make a point of order pursuant to Rules 4 and 125.', 'The French Members from the National Front are present in the House. However, we will not take part in the vote on the amendments for a fundamental legal reason: we are national Members representing 15 different nations, not a single European nation. Moreover, to accept a statute for Members of the European Parliament would be to change our status from being a matter of international law to being a matter of internal constitutional law. We do not want that, which is why we will not take part in the vote.', '(Mixed reactions)', 'President . – Very well, that is your right. We note the fact that you are present, but not taking part in the vote.', 'Lehideux (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, I am somewhat surprised that Members are forced to act as if they are in a fairground to be able to speak in Parliament. However, apart from that, I would simply like to say that this is the first time that I have seen in a House such as ours a situation where two opposing views are set out, one by the services responsible and the other by the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure – who is elected by his peers – and where that of the relevant services has prevailed.', 'President . – No, Mr Lehideux, it is not the services, but the President who interprets the Rules of Procedure, and so the decision is entirely mine and my responsibility. That is the decision which has been taken. As always, I accept responsibility for the decisions which I take, be they right or wrong.', '(Parliament adopted the resolution)', '(Applaus)', 'Wulf‐Mathies, Commission. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the votes on the Rothley report on the Statute for Members, I can only confirm that the opinion delivered by the Commission pursuant to Article 190(5) of the Amsterdam Treaty stands unchanged.', '(Applaus)', 'IN THE CHAIR: MRS FONTAINE\\nVice‐President', 'Report (A4‐0254/99) by Mrs van Putten, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on measures to promote full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries (COM(99)0036 – C4‐0130/99‐99/0020(COD))', '(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)', 'van Putten (PSE), rapporteur. – (NL) Madam President, after 10 years the circle is complete.

However, I would like to remind him that we are committed to a Europe of the heart, a Europe of solidarity, and not a Europe of markets alone. We have already experimented with the formulas of a lesser role for the state and the blind belief that the rules of competition or liberalisation generate employment. We no longer believe in them. We know that to create jobs again we will need further growth and growth that will actually generate employment. And we would call on Mr Prodi to present us with proposals in that direction. Equally, in terms of a social Europe, our people would not understand why no progress was being made.', 'I would like to make one final comment, Madam President. At a time when a war is breaking out in our continent, we do not understand how religious diversity is not respected. As far as we are concerned, the principle of secularism is a founding principle of our Union. Non‐discrimination as regards religion has been enshrined in our Treaty. We will judge Mr Prodi on his respect for this commitment.', 'Lienemann (PSE). ‐ (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the appointment of Mr Romano Prodi. His speech before Parliament was marked by the most traditional form of liberalism; it was dull and lacking in any vision for the future. There is nothing in his statements that refers clearly to the need to defend and update the European social model. There is nothing about the need for a new pact that balances the forces of labour and the holders of capital. There is nothing about the redistribution of wealth.', 'The social Europe does not concern him. But it does concern millions of Europeans. He is not proposing any serious strategy to promote employment, preferring to suggest that we simply follow the same monetarist macro‐economic policy we have been following for years, a policy that has proved ineffective in terms of establishing sustainable growth and significantly reducing unemployment.', 'He made a long plea regarding the need to continue with deregulation and the liberalisation of all sectors of the economy. I did not hear him defending general interest services or public services. In short, his commitments have very little to do with the hopes and expectations of the people, who have demonstrated their desire for change and elected Socialist or Social Democrat governments in most of our countries. Mr Prodi is telling them that tomorrow will be just like yesterday. We cannot accept that.', 'I was also surprised to see Mr Prodi making an explicit reference to Christian values as a form of heritage that should be defended in Europe. Of course, I am not raising any objections to these values, nor am I denying Mr Prodi his freedom of conscience, but I support the principle of secularism – which rightly guarantees this fundamental liberty everywhere and for everyone – and I therefore expect a President of the Commission to uphold this principle. But I have my doubts about that.', 'Mr Prodi has the right to be a Christian Democrat, but I expect the European Union, where most of the governments are left‐wing, to be led by someone who is likely to embody these ideals and these policies. That does not seem to be the case.', 'Ripa di Meana (GUE/NGL). – (IT) Madam President, I have no confidence in President‐designate Romano Prodi because he has justified NATO\"s war by calling it ‘necessary\". This is a war in Europe initiated and conducted in violation of every principle of international law, in contempt of the United Nations. The Treaty establishing the Atlantic Alliance states that it is a defensive organisation, but NATO\"s war in Yugoslavia actually perverts the nature of that vocation.', 'So a dark and bloody conflict has broken out on our continent, and now no one is in any position to predict the outcome or calculate the consequences for the future of our European peoples.', 'By calling for an the immediate end to the ethnic massacres and the bombing, in the name of the ‘European soul\", President‐designate Romano Prodi could have taken an influential and balanced role, decisive for the future work of the Commission. He did not do so, he identified himself with the interventionists, and lost a precious and long‐awaited opportunity.', '(Applause from the left)', 'Barros Moura (PSE), in writing. – (PT) I voted in favour of the nominee for President this time round, whereas in July 1994 I voted against Mr Santer. Unfortunately, I was not mistaken then, as events have now demonstrated.', 'I hope that the political will indicated by Mr Prodi to reestablish the balance between the institutions will bear fruit so that the Commission can reassume its essential political driving role as a body independent of the national governments and private interests. To do this, the European Parliament must also fulfil its role in order to avoid the return to an intergovernmental Europe with a ‘governing body\" consisting of the large Member States.', 'However, I must indicate my extreme surprise and condemnation of the way in which Mr Prodi, on page 11 of the verbatim report of proceedings, characterised the European consciousness, which is at the root of the integration achieved in the last 50 years. He described this as being exclusively ‘erede della cultura umanística e della cultura cristiana \" meaning that it has its origins in humanism and Christianity. This characterisation diminishes the origins of European civilisation by specifically disregarding the contribution of the Jewish and Muslim cultures. The use of the term ‘cristiana \" or ‘Christian\" is not only an unacceptable falsification of history but also, given the current events in Europe, an unpardonable political error.', 'Bernardini (PSE), in writing. – (FR) Our House is today giving its opinion on the appointment of Mr Prodi as President of the European Commission. I must vote against this appointment and withhold my vote of confidence.', 'Mr Prodi, you appeared as the saviour of a foundering institution, as the person who could provide the charisma needed for the job. But your obviously strong personality cannot be separated from the objective of your politics. Moreover, having listened to your comments and to your programme, I am extremely concerned.', 'Since the beginning of my term in office, I have fought to change the prevailing philosophy within the Brussels executive. I have fought to ensure that the liberal Europe, the Europe of markets, gave way to a social Europe.', 'After listening to you yesterday, I am disappointed that not a single reference was made to the social Europe. There was not a word about the concept of public services; instead, we listened to a eulogy to economic liberalism.', 'Mr Prodi, you refuse to distinguish between the market‐based Europe and the social Europe. But you must be aware that our people cannot support the European idea if the only option available is a market where the role of the individual is obsolete.', 'You will have the difficult task of establishing Europe in a new millennium, and I cannot get used to the idea that the twenty‐first century might represent a negation of the social Europe.', 'You succeeded in the formidable task of enabling your country to join the euro. I hoped that, with your appointment, you would establish the proper social dimension that Europe requires. I did not hear this in your speech and you have disappointed me. I therefore cannot give you a free hand to carry out this role.', 'Blak (PSE), in writing. – (DA) I have today voted against the approval of Romano Prodi as the new President of the Commission.', \"Mr Prodi has not been sufficiently convincing in his acknowledgement of the need for a social Europe. All we have heard is that tired old tune about full liberalisation and more growth being the solution to Europe's problems. He has not voiced the desire to make active use of the new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty with regard to the environment or employment. Mr Prodi's future plans for the development of Europe also go too far in a federal direction. Amongst other things, he is seeking to extend European cooperation in the fields of defence and foreign affairs. His ambitions in the sphere of equal opportunities have unfortunately also been non‐existent. Mr Prodi has not outlined any plans for greater equality between men and women either within the college of Commissioners or in the Directorates‐General.\", \"Romano Prodi's ambitions in the human and social sectors are therefore too slight to persuade me to vote in favour of his nomination.\", 'Féret (NI), in writing. – (FR) At the time, I voted in favour of the appointment of Jacques Santer as President of the Commission, in the knowledge that he had been prime minister of a small country, like my own, but one that had been much less affected by extra‐European immigration, by unemployment and by taxation. I warned him about accepting the best and the worst in terms of the heads of the various departments; unfortunately, the worst prevailed.', 'Mr Prodi\"s speech could not have been more disappointing. He talked to us for a long time about the Europe of money. He did not say a word about the Europe of people. He did not provide us with any hope that we might be able to put an end to the new world order imposed by the Yankees. There was no condemnation, or even regret, in relation to the unacceptable military attack against a European nation by a NATO that is blindly killing women and children.', 'I cannot in all conscience put my trust in a politician who has joined the camp of the enemies of Europe.', 'Ilivitzky (GUE/NGL), in writing. – (FI) I abstained in the election of the President of the Commission, as I could not see how I could give my support to Mr Prodi. His appearance in the European Parliament was not enough to reassure me that he would be the right person to lead the Commission during the next five‐year term. Mr Prodi\"s bottom line is the formation of a Federal Europe, which is difficult for me to accept.', 'Most worrying of all when Mr Prodi was here in Parliament were his ideas on employment, the regulation of the labour market and the public sector. He repeatedly stressed the need to deregulate the labour market and to increase the practice of bilateral agreements between employers and workers. He considered the public sector to be too large in scale and called for rationalisation and cost‐cutting measures. Meanwhile, he had nothing more than pious messages of hope for increased employment.', 'Mr Prodi sets great store by a common defence policy for Europe. He failed to give adequate guarantees that non‐aligned EU Member States would be able to remain outside the military alliance.', 'Nevertheless, I did not consider I could vote against his appointment, as that would mean a serious delay in appointing the new Commission. With the situation as it is, it is important that the new Commission should begin work as soon as possible.', 'Lage and Marinho (PSE), in writing. – (PT) Mr Prodi did not at first sight seem to have all the qualities required for a necessarily strong and active leadership of the European Union. Due to their style and beliefs, other people were better qualified to preside over the Commission. However, his experience in Italian politics, his acknowledged personal and political integrity and his capacity for establishing dialogue and unity are basic virtues which can breathe life into the European project.', 'Through his speeches in Parliament, he has gradually outlined his beliefs on Europe. These contain many positive aspects, particularly the desire to guarantee the independence of the Commission and to carry out a root‐and‐branch reform of its administrative practices. We would also highlight the importance which Mr Prodi has placed on Mediterranean policies, which he regards as being just as important as enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, his will to help make the European economy more dynamic and reduce unemployment and, essentially for us, the defence of economic and social cohesion. We note, however, that the social side was virtually totally absent from his speeches, which is worrying. Overall, there are reasons why we have high expectations of the new Commission President and this is why we are voting in favour of his appointment. We now hope that our expectations can be reinforced and that Mr Prodi can be the President the Commission needs following the period of weakness we have seen with Mr Santer.', 'The Portuguese Socialists support a strong Commission which is capable of mobilising the will of the European people and which respects these people and their legitimate interests, particularly in small countries such as Portugal. We also demand an independent Commission which, within the structure of the Community institutions, can contribute to achieving a balance between all the Member States, whether small or large and whether in the south or north of Europe.', 'Lindeperg (PSE), in writing. – (FR) I had decided to vote in favour of the appointment of Mr Prodi as President of the European Commission. I was satisfied with both the speed and efficiency with which the Council had taken its decision and with the standing in European terms of a man who, with great panache and know‐how, had led a left‐wing Italian Government under difficult conditions and had led Italy into EMU.', 'However, his speech yesterday worried me and I have now decided to abstain. Parliament, and in particular my group, the Socialist Group, has often highlighted the need to balance the economic and monetary pillar with a social pillar and a firm commitment to a political Europe.', 'What I listened to yesterday was a liberal credo that leads me to fear greatly that this new balance is not on the agenda of the next Commission. Moreover, my secular view of public life was shattered.', 'That is why I am abstaining. I hope that my fears will not be justified and, in any event, that the vigilance of the next Parliament and its commitment to a social Europe will ensure that they are unfounded.', 'Lindqvist (ELDR), Bonde, Lis Jensen, Krarup and Sandbæk (I‐EDN), in writing. – (SV) We have voted against the appointment of Romano Prodi as President of the Commission for the following reasons.', \"Romano Prodi has indicated that he is in favour of the EU developing on federal lines into a kind of United States of Europe. He has repeatedly stressed the need for a common defence and hence the militarisation of the EU. In his address and in answers to questions, it is noticeable that he has often compared the EU to the USA, with a view to establishing a ‘balance over the Atlantic'. We are opposed to the development of an ‘EU state' and believe that European cooperation should, for the most part, be based on intergovernmental cooperation between independent nations.\", 'The appointment of the President of the Commission and the Commission provides us with a good opportunity to carry out reforms which would reinforce democracy in Europe. The EU should have a modern administration and transparent legislation along the lines of the Nordic model. This would mean open Council meetings and public access to official records, whereby everyone would be entitled to examine public documents and records in all the EU institutions and to speak out freely, in other words to be able to inform the media and those outside the EU institutions about mistakes and wrong‐doing in the administration.', 'Moreover, reforms to increase openness should be extended to the system of appointments in the EU institutions. An appointment should only be made following an application and on the basis of qualifications, not political patronage. All employees should be aware that proficiency and merit, not friendship and connections, are the requirements for being appointed.', 'The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority. The concentration of responsibility in the hands of a minority should be broken. Staff reforms should be carried out in order to weed out EU privileges. It is indefensible that an employee in the EU earns three times as much for doing the same job as he or she would in a Member State, and enjoys diplomatic status with immunity from punishment and other fringe benefits.', \"The salary of the President of the Commission should also have been reduced before an appointment was made. Commissioners should receive the same salary as ministers in the country which they represent. Moving expenses should be paid on the basis of an estimate and not in the form of two months' additional salary of around SEK 360 000.\", 'The EU should concentrate on the big issues, distinguish between what is trivial and what is important, and carry out genuine decentralising reforms which would result in matters that should not be dealt with at EU level being handed back to the Member States. All these reform proposals should be implemented, but no such promise has been given.', 'Our vision is one of free European people in a democratic and diverse Europe. We do not want a United States of Europe, but a Europe of nations.', 'Mutin (PSE), in writing. – (FR) After listening to Mr Prodi\"s speech before Parliament, we cannot have any doubts as to his desire to clean up and improve the functioning of the Commission, but equally, we do not have any doubts as to his desire to continue to build a liberal Europe where no consideration is given to the role of workers. He did not say a word about social dialogue, about public services or about the need to establish the core of fundamental social rights we require to prevent relocations through fiscal dumping. The fact that Mr Prodi was actually nominated by 11 Socialist or Social Democrat governments proves that the social Europe is not the priority and that the liberal approach has not been discarded.', 'Nonetheless, I am convinced that the rights of the people of Europe will only improve if we build a strong, political Europe based on the principle of secularism. To achieve this, we must reopen the divide between the right and the left, turn Parliament into a truly political body and stop looking for consensus, as the governments did when nominating Mr Prodi. That is why I am opposed to his nomination as head of the Commission.', 'Pailler (GUE/NGL), in writing. – (FR) I was foolish enough to believe that the future President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, would send us an ambitious message to enable us to emerge from the institutional and political crisis that led to the resignation of the Commission, against the backdrop of the war in Kosovo.', 'Unfortunately, apart from some general statements and the promise of rigorous and transparent management, his speech gave me greater cause for concern than for anything else.', 'After Jacques Delors and the very liberal Commissioner, Mr Bangemann, he in turn is conforming to the myth of the overriding power of the Internet and information highways and is promising us paradise through the fact that ‘we can bridge the gap between us and the United States\".', 'To respond to these global challenges, we must inevitably ‘reform the welfare model\" and ‘review ... the rules governing labour markets and professional markets to lower the barriers preventing access and ... make the employment situation more responsive to economic growth\".', 'Naturally, as Mr Prodi goes on to tell us, this will only happen if we can ‘make public administrations lighter of touch\". In spite of the first stinging failure of the MAI, Mr Prodi himself is taking up Commissioner Brittan\"s ideology: ‘The EU should continue along the path of multilateral liberalisation within the World Trade Organisation. Our aim is to prevent all attempts at protectionism ...\". Following the example of the United States, will the future Commission look on our social and environmental clauses as protectionist? It is vital to include them in our trade mechanisms to ensure that globalisation is based on cooperation and solidarity with the poorest regions and countries.', 'But the final blow to a progressive European project is perhaps his idea of European culture: he seems to consider this in terms of the past and believes it to be our only heritage. For the future, he turns to ‘the power of American culture\", which ‘in the broad sense and as expressed in symbolic form by the media is actually believed by some to be capable of acting as a single point of reference for a Europe in quest of its soul. There is nothing discreditable about such a supposition ...\" In other words, just a few months before the WTO negotiations, Mr Prodi\"s Europe is surrendering before having even waged the political war.', 'The liberal European hymn sung by Romano Prodi is based on the flexibility and adaptability of work, mistrust of public services and allegiance to American culture.', 'As a result, I voted against his appointment as President of the Commission.', 'Papakyriazis (PSE), in writing. – (EL) The European Parliament\"s endorsement of Mr Prodi as President of the Commission, which I was very happy to vote in favour of, opens up a new era for the European Union at what is a turning point for Europe and the world as a whole. In conjunction with the European elections on 13 June 1999, the European Union needs to confirm its unswerving dedication to the principles of democracy, solidarity, justice, transparency, stability and peace.', 'The people of Europe – of the 15 Member States and the applicant countries of Eastern Europe and Cyprus – hope and demand that the European Union becomes a real political and social union, with the required authority and validity to play a leading world role as we approach the millennium.', \"Spiers (PSE), in writing. ‐ I voted to approve Mr Prodi's nomination, but with reservations.\", 'The overriding priority of the incoming Commission President should be to ensure good management and financial control within the Commission. It should not be to increase European integration or to build a federal Europe. To coin a phrase, the European Union should do less, better.', 'Theorin (PSE), in writing. – (SV) Although I voted for Mr Prodi as President of the Commission, I do not accept the strongly federalist views regarding a common defence and a common system of taxation that were put forward by Mr Prodi in his policy statement. Sweden joined on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation, it did not join a federation. In my view, Mr Prodi does not represent traditional social democratic policy either, which I would have preferred.', 'Valverde López (PPE), in writing. – (ES) Parliament can have no objection to the general content of the speech by Mr Prodi on his intentions. Nonetheless, some general ideas need to be explained in detail so as to avoid ambiguities in the institutions\" interpretation of them. I fully agree that we need to define the political and administrative responsibilities of the European Commission. The Commission should review its files, where it would find questions and motions for resolutions that I tabled proposing that rules for legislative procedures and for administrative justice be drawn up in order to define responsibilities and provide our citizens with legal certainty. In the doctrinal tradition of national democracies, the responsibilities of the government and the administration are clearly defined.', 'Another fundamental issue is that of preserving the overall responsibility of the College of Commissioners. The individual responsibilities of the Commissioners can and must be defined, yet we must not entirely discard the principle of collective responsibility. To accept the individual condemnation of a Commissioner would mean the death of the independence of the European Commission. I have also on various occasions defended the need for the Commissioners to meticulously respect their ethical commitment to maintain the necessary independence from their governments. The Commissioners must oversee the EU\"s common interest; they must not use their post first and foremost to defend their country of origin. Nationalist statements by Commissioners should be dealt with by the President, who should ask them to leave the Commission. In the same way, the Commissioners\" private offices must have a supranational structure, as I have maintained for years.', 'The Commission must also resist the destructive urge to try to represent the main political trend in the European Parliament, even though some prominent figures may promote it. This would disrupt the nature of the institutions. The European Parliament has no reason to support the European Commission because of its political stance. Compared to national parliaments, the great asset and advantage of the European Parliament is that we are all part of the opposition here. No political group is obliged to keep the Commission in office. The legislative arm must have complete freedom to monitor the executive arm. In addition to this, the Commission should not in any way relinquish its power to initiate legislation.', 'Mr Prodi, I am a committed federalist, and I have every confidence that your future activities will continue to enhance the unique nature of the EU institutions and prevent it from being interfered with.', '‐ Rothley report (A4‐0267/99)', 'Cox (ELDR). – Madam President, obviously in this House we are parliamentarians and democrats. As a democrat I have to accept the result of the vote on the Rothley report even if I do not agree with it. As a parliamentarian I have to accept that we use procedures sometimes as a way of either promoting or shielding ourselves from particular votes.', 'I want to express my deep sense of disappointment that yesterday, at an early stage, when my group presented to other group presidents the possibility of trying to find a reasonable way forward, whereby the Council would meet tonight and then, tomorrow, we could decide on the issue in a more definitive way, some colleagues used procedures in this House to block that possibility.', 'I express in particular my grave disappointment at Amendment No 27 in the name of Mrs Green and Mr Cot, who removed Article 1 from the Rothley report and ipso facto removed from it the possibility of the Liberal amendment. That amendment genuinely sought to address many of the fears that Members had expressed as deficiencies in the Council\\'s response. For example, it put MEPs on an equal footing with national parliamentary representatives in the matter of various allowances and expenses. It included clauses on the acquired rights, the so‐called ‘grandfather clause\". It included options for early retirement, which many Members said they wanted. It included the full protection of the acquired pension rights, the existing pension rights of Members, and other elements as well. In all of that it was a genuine attempt to recognise that the Rothley report simpliciter of last December clearly will not win unanimous approval of the Council; that the Council\\'s text of last week clearly will not win the support of this House. And this via media which we sought to bring forward – and as democrats we have to accept the win or loss – was blown out of the water by a procedure which disgusts me.', 'Green (PSE). – Madam President, clearly, as Mr Cox has mentioned, the amendment tabled in my name on behalf of the Socialist Group was tabled by the Socialist Group. As the leader, I had my name on it, but for the record, I voted against it.', 'Cox (ELDR). – Madam President, I was not aware of that. I thank Mrs Green for that explanation. Personally, I had understood that was her position. I thank her for clarifying it. I still remain disgusted by the procedure but I would wish, at least, to place on the record my appreciation of what Mrs Green has just said.', 'Green (PSE). – Madam President, I should like to put on record my disgust as well at what has happened.', 'Berthu (I‐EDN). – (FR) Madam President, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations did not agree with the draft uniform Statute for Members of the European Parliament adopted by our House on 3 December 1998. We believed at the time, and we still believe, that the Members of the European Parliament represent their respective nations and that they should continue to have the status of national representatives.', 'Since 3 December, the Council has examined Parliament\"s draft and has unfortunately approved its key principles. In its view, the Members of the European Parliament should from now on be paid out of the Community budget and not by their countries of origin. Moreover, they should pay income tax to the Communities, under the same conditions as those that apply to European officials. Only a temporary derogation is provided for to maintain the national system of taxation for those countries which request it explicitly.', 'This amended draft is equally unacceptable. It is totally incredible that the Members of the European Parliament might be paid by someone other than the people they represent. It is equally incredible that they might be subject to a tax system that is different from that of their fellow citizens, particularly if this is also a less severe tax system, as would be the case here. This reform is obviously designed to draw Members away from defending their people in order to encourage them to defend the supranational system that will support them.', 'It is somewhat difficult to understand the deep‐rooted motives of the Council when it accepts a text that is so opposed to the interests of the Member States, unless it, too, agrees tacitly to the establishment of a European superstate. This interpretation unfortunately seems to be correct, as it is backed up by many other indications. Once again, we see that the governments are playing a double game and establishing – by indirect methods – a system that the people would not accept if they were consulted in full knowledge of the facts.', 'Breyer (V). – (DE) Madam President, I wish to make a personal statement. I voted against Mr Rothley\"s proposal because I am sorry we did not accept the Council document, which meant that we missed a major opportunity finally to obtain a statute at the end of this legislative term. You all know how difficult it will be to make progress on a statute during the new term. It will be wellnigh impossible. I fear that Parliament\"s action has merely relegated the Statute to a kind of shunting yard. I thought it was right for us finally to get some movement into the Statute, and the words ‘equal pay for all\" apply just as much to the Council; its members also do the same work but have different salaries. There are hundreds of journalists who do the same work for different pay.', 'I regarded the compromise as viable even if – which is not, of course, a good thing – it would have meant that Swedish, Danish and British Members were taxed under their national rules. But I got the impression that was not the issue at all; rather it was to go on relegating the Statute for Members to the shunting yard. I very much regretted that. That is why I voted against Mr Rothley\"s proposal and would have liked to vote for the Council proposal.', 'McKenna (V). – Madam President, like Mrs Breyer, I would like to say this is a missed opportunity. Although many people have expressed their disgust, I do not know how we are going to go back to the electorate and justify that basically things are remaining the same. The Liberal and Green amendment was deliberately sabotaged by people who do not want to see the system changed. Although I would have had major problems with the idea of an EU tax system – it is not something I could support – or that our salaries would be increased, we need to deal with the way in which expenses are dished out in this Parliament. What is wrong with having a system whereby you have to account for what you spend? We now have to go out in June to look for votes from the electorate. The one thing that everybody is focused on is how the repayment system works in this Parliament. We have to look for change. Today was a prime opportunity. We missed that because of political manoeuvring within Parliament. It is going to very difficult for us to justify our position. That is why I voted against the Rothley report. I would have had major problems with a salary increase or with the idea of an EU‐wide tax system. That is the thin edge of the wedge. I do not agree with a harmonised tax system or with – as Mr Berthu said – many of the harmonisations that are going on within the EU.', 'I voted against Prodi basically because he is a complete federalist and also in favour of the militarising of the EU which I do not approve of. That is why I had to vote against him.', 'Donnelly, Brendan (PPE). – Madam President, I do not normally give explanations of vote but on this occasion I shall, because this may have been one of the last actions in this present Parliament, and I want to avoid any possible misunderstanding about what is perhaps an ambiguous vote. I did vote against the Rothley report because I take the view that, with all its faults, we should have accepted the proposed Statute for Members that came from the Council.', 'I take that view with some regret because Mr Rothley is a very distinguished Member of this Parliament who has contributed a great deal to its work. In general I am always very sympathetic to the idea that Parliament should defend its rights and its position vis‐à‐vis other institutions. But on this occasion, particularly in view of the coming election, I took the view that it was better for us to get this matter behind us. I have always taken the view that Parliament must rigorously and ruthlessly defend its constitutional and legal rights. When, however, it is a question of its own personal rights, the rights of its Members – particularly the financial rights of its Members – Parliament would be well advised to tread more softly. There is a difference between the two. If I had to be asked what Parliament needs, I do not think it is more formal powers, I think it is to come closer to the minds, hearts and spirits of the electorate. I am afraid the postponement of the Statute may stand in the way of that.', 'I know that you, Madam President, have a different view. I am sorry, on this last occasion, to have to differ. I have always had great respect, both political and personal, for you. But unlike many who voted against the Rothley report I did so because I believe the European Parliament should be more powerful, more influential, should play a larger role in the European Union. It was my view that by voting against the Rothley report I could serve that political goal.', 'Fabre‐Aubrespy (I‐EDN). – (FR) Madam President, as far as procedure is concerned, I would like to inform Mr Cox and Mrs Green – although they have left – that on 3 December, I had tabled an amendment similar to the global amendments, which have been the subject of long debate, and that that amendment had been declared inadmissible at the time, perhaps because I had tabled it.', 'On a personal note, regarding the Rothley report, I would like to say that the truth has been revealed. The majority of Members of this House – 376 Members – have shown that in actual fact they did not want the system for reimbursing travel expenses to be changed. That is what is at issue here.', 'The resolution adopted on 3 December stated that thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, for the first time in its history the European Parliament was in a position to adopt itself a single statute for Members, and that this statute should enter into force as soon as the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam provided a legal basis for its adoption. This gave the impression that we were prepared to adopt a statute.', 'However, given the rejection today of our Amendment No 18, which stated that we would do our utmost to ensure that this statute entered into force at the beginning of the next parliamentary term, Parliament is showing its true colours, and on the very day and in the very week when a new system for the reimbursement of travel expenses is being adopted, a system which is supposedly based on expenses actually incurred but is actually somewhat similar to a lump‐sum system.', 'That is why we voted against the Rothley report. Parliament does not want to be open and transparent about the way in which its Members are paid, and that is particularly scandalous in terms of public opinion.', 'Andersson, Hulthén, Lööw, Palm and Sandberg‐Fries (PSE), in writing. – (SV) The current system of reimbursement is absurd, particularly with regard to travel expenses. We need to bring about a change and find a solution in order to deal with the absurdity of the situation, but also because there are other important issues, besides the salaries of its own Members, which the European Parliament ought to be concentrating on.', 'We support the compromise which the Council reached in April. We should like to have a uniform statute giving all Members the same salary, but with the possibility of taxation at national level.', \"Blak, Iversen, Kirsten Jensen and Sindal (PSE), in writing. – (DA) The Danish Social Democrats support the Council's amended draft Statute for Members, because the European Parliament needs to put its own house in order before the elections. It is not possible to wait and negotiate with the Council. We have endorsed a proposed compromise which brings us slightly nearer to our objective, in the hope of at least avoiding the whole matter being rejected outright.\", \"Donnelly, Alan (PSE), in writing. ‐ The European Parliamentary Labour Party has pushed for reform of all the EU's institutions. We have pressed for more transparency in the Council. We have been at the forefront of the work to ensure openness and better management in the Commission and we now come to put our own house – Parliament – in order.\", 'The EPLP has consistently campaigned for a coherent and transparent system in which MEPs could operate.', 'We have voted this morning to try to ensure that concrete measures are put in place as quickly as possible.', 'We have been at the forefront of reform and believe that we have to reach a conclusion on this matter and start the new mandate with a statute in place. We have pressed for a transparent system of payments for travel expenses, an equal salary for MEPs from all countries, and a proper method of direct payments for staff.', 'The Council has said that it will look at the detail of implementation of the Statute alongside Parliament and we look forward to playing an active role in those further negotiations over the new few weeks.', 'Graenitz PSE), in writing. – (DE) I abstained from all the votes because I will be leaving the European Parliament and do not wish to decide on the Statute for future Members.', 'Lage and Marinho (PSE), in writing. – (PT) The Portuguese Socialist Members voted against the motion for a resolution approved today in the European Parliament because this motion prevents the entry into force of the Statute for Members proposed by the Council of Ministers which represents an important reinforcement of Parliament\"s credibility.', 'The continuation of the current set of rules postpones a long‐standing desire of the European Parliament to finally achieve the principle of equality between all Members. The new Statute was characterised by strictness and transparency in the rights and duties of all the Members and would have done away, once and for all, with the vagaries and speculation which are the preferred recourse of all those who thereby aim to undermine the value of political action.', 'The European Parliament has missed an unparalleled opportunity to resolve an issue which is fundamental to its good image and dignity, especially at a time when transparency and efficiency in the workings of all the Community institutions are being discussed and demanded in Europe.', 'Lagendijk (V), in writing. – (FR) The outcome of today\"s vote, which saw a majority of our House give its support to the Rothley report, is a defeat as far as we are concerned. This majority, which invoked all sorts of legal arguments, was concerned first and foremost with maintaining our salaries and privileges at all costs. For a long time, a majority in this Parliament has been hiding behind the lack of initiative from the Council in this matter in order to excuse its unwillingness to conclude a statute for Members of the European Parliament.', 'After several years of work, a proposal had been drawn up that was, in general, satisfactory, and the Council had indicated that it was willing to negotiate with Parliament, following the result of today\"s vote, with a view to finding a compromise.', 'The response of the majority in this House today does not match up to its commitments to its own voters or to the expectations of public opinion. Following the Commission\"s resignation and the problems of fraud and poor financial management, how can the majority in this Parliament justify the fact that our House is incapable of reforming anything that affects our allowances and the financial management of our institution?', 'My group is going to continue fighting the battle we began a long time ago. But each of our colleagues who voted in favour of the Rothley report will have to shoulder their responsibilities in terms of public opinion and the postponement of the uniform Statute for Members of the European Parliament.', \"Lindholm (V), in writing. – (SV) The vicissitudes surrounding the establishment of a statute for Members of the European Parliament have been many and complex. As the only Swedish member of the committee, I was closely involved, over a six‐month period, in following and contributing to the discussions, in particular through the tabling of an amendment reflecting the Greens' viewpoint. This expressed our opposition to the detachment of MEPs from their own voters and Member States by such things as the introduction of EU salaries, EU taxes, EU pensions and so on. I do not think, therefore, that it is desirable to have a statute which regulates these matters.\", 'However, we need to tackle the excessively generous allowances, for example those covering travel and office expenses, and to introduce a system whereby only the costs actually incurred are reimbursed. Under the Rules of Procedure, this can be done at any time and without the introduction of a statute. It is therefore unacceptable that Parliament has hitherto done nothing about it, since it would have been a simple matter – had the will existed. In view of these considerations, I voted against the report.', 'Lindqvist (ELDR), Eriksson, Seppänen, Sjöstedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), Holm and Schörling (V), Bonde, Lis Jensen, Krarup and Sandbæk (I‐EDN), in writing. – (DA) We are absolutely convinced that Members of the European Parliament are elected by the people of the Member States to represent the voters\\' interest in the EU. The remuneration and taxation of MEPs is therefore a national affair. We are consequently opposed to a uniform European statute on Members\" remuneration. We advocate that the current remuneration and reimbursement system should be discontinued, since it means that Members of this Parliament are paid large sums in expenses which have not been incurred. It is therefore necessary to establish a new system of remuneration and reimbursement, whereby the reimbursement of expenses must be accompanied by a bill, and payment is dependent on the Member signing a declaration that the expenses have actually been incurred in connection with the exercise of their mandate.', 'On 26 April 1999, the Council drew up a draft Statute based on the European Parliament\\'s text. In this draft, the Council sets out a series of proposals regarding the Statute, stating amongst other things that the payment of reimbursements will be based on vouchers, and proposals are also made regarding the establishment of conditions of employment for assistants. We believe that the Council\\'s text is a distinct improvement on the European Parliament\\'s draft Statute, which was adopted on 3 December 1998. We shall therefore support those parts of the draft which tighten up the current arrangements for reimbursement and lay down proper conditions of employment for assistants. We wish to emphasise, however, that Members\\' salaries must be taxed at national level, and the revenues must therefore go to the Member States. We are opposed to an EU tax system, and we therefore cannot support the Council\\'s ‘should\" clause in Article 8(6), which states that the revenues should be paid back into the EU\\'s budget.', \"We believe that the adoption of the Statute is yet another step towards a United States of Europe, with the European Parliament as a co‐legislator. Mr Rothley's draft report shows this quite plainly, and it is a clear example of how far removed the European Parliament has become from the interests of the people. The only reason why we can support parts of the draft for the new Statute is that we believe that it is a vital step towards remedying the European Parliament's long‐standing squandering of our taxpayers' money.\", 'Martinez (NI), in writing. – (FR) The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for a statute for Members of the European Parliament. Article 190(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community gives Parliament the power to ‘lay down\" this statute.', 'Some of our Spanish, Portuguese and other colleagues are in favour of this, not only for ideological reasons, but also perhaps for the sake of convenience. In fact, on the basis of national statutes, there was discrimination between the German Members, whose thriving economy allowed them to receive substantial allowances, and our Portuguese colleagues, whose moderate economy meant that they only received moderate allowances.', 'The Members of the National Front in the European Parliament are opposed to this European Statute for legal reasons which serve to nullify it.', 'Members of the Parliament in Strasbourg are, in fact, the representatives of 15 different nations; they are not the elected representatives of a European nation. They represent the 15 national sovereignties and not a European sovereignty. Furthermore, the European Parliament\"s legal basis originates in an international treaty and not in an internal legislative text. It is an intergovernmental institution and organisation, not an institution that is based on a constitution.', 'Our legal status is therefore international rather than constitutional. That is why the Statute for Members is a political strike against the legal texts on which Parliament is based. It is the first element of a European federal constitution and it is being introduced in a surreptitious and clandestine manner. And that is the last straw as far as a parliament is concerned. A parliament represents the people. Yet here the European Parliament is progressively imposing on them a federal constitution within its powers while the people\"s backs are turned.', 'This is all the more serious since if national Members were paid out of the European budget from now on and paid taxes into that budget, they would no longer have any financial or fiscal links with their people. How then would the Members of the European Parliament be able to represent their country of origin when their links with it are being gradually weakened?', 'Today we have the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, we already have the European currency, and tomorrow it will be the European state.', 'Pohjamo, Ryynänen and Virrankoski (ELDR), in writing. ‐ (FI) We voted in favour of the amendment by the Liberal Group with regard to Parliament\"s system of pay and expenses, as it was the only way to bring into effect a reform that has taken a long time to prepare, and one that many had called for. We do not believe the matter can be postponed any longer, but feel that this vital reform should be introduced before the start of the new Parliament.', 'We believe that the central issues of the reform are the standardisation of pay for Members, national taxation and bona fide travel expenses.', 'Theorin (PSE), in writing. – (SV) From the very beginning I have asked for a special travel card to be introduced, like the one used in the Swedish Parliament. As parliamentarians, we should be reimbursed the travel costs actually incurred.', 'We need to establish a statute for Members of the European Parliament in order to change the unsatisfactory system which exists at present. A basic requirement, which the Swedish Government has also pressed for in the Council, is that national tax should be deducted instead of EU tax. I share that view. I have stated on many occasions that, in my opinion, our salaries should be the same as those of Swedish Members of Parliament.', 'We now need to come up with a proposal without delay.', 'Thors (ELDR), in writing. – (SV) The Conservative and Socialist groups in Parliament, through their action today, have jeopardised the credibility of the European Parliament by rejecting the proposal for a Members\" statute put forward by the Liberal Group. Legal chicanery and trickery have played a significant part in this.', \"Had the Liberal Group's proposal been approved, we should have been able to go to the polls with our flag flying high and showing that we had not only cleaned up the European Commission, but inside our own house as well. The Liberal Group's proposal was a realistic one, and would have made it possible to reach an agreement with the Council of Ministers before Parliament rose for the elections.\", 'The political groups which backed the rejection of the proposals from both the Liberal Group and the Council of Ministers are responsible for the fact that we have got nowhere with reform. Instead, we are left with a dubious proposal on travel expenses.', 'In the course of our work, the Liberals have consistently pressed for an accelerated timetable of reforms. The fact that some groups, so close to the finishing post, have been intransigent and in no hurry for reform, also leaves one feeling bitter.', \"The draft Statute contains many worthwhile points: a uniform salary, but with the possibility of imposing national tax in those countries which wish to do so; clear rules governing the declaration of Members' interests; and transparency in expenses and travel allowances, on the basis of actual costs. The European Parliament would also have been able to reinforce its legitimacy by not having the sole right of approval of its own salaries, like other parliaments.\", 'Torres Marques (PSE), in writing. – (PT) I abstained from voting on the Rothley report because I feel that this is not the time to approve this statute, as so many wanted. The lists of candidates are now ready and the rules would have been changed without the potential new Members being able to participate in the vote. However, I consider that it will be imperative to approve the Statute for Members of the European Parliament as soon as possible after Parliament reopens in July.', 'Thyssen (PPE), in writing. – (NL) I voted against the resolution on the Statute for Members of Parliament. My fundamental reason for doing so is perfectly simple. As a Member of the European Parliament I am fed up with being constantly criticised and attacked about our allowances, travel expenses and other such matters.', 'The Statute on which the Council has reached a compromise is not perfect and I understand the Members who criticise it. For me, however, these shortcomings are far outweighed by my desire to be able to begin the next parliamentary term with a totally clean slate and with the prospect of no longer having to devote our time to decisions about our own statute.', 'This is why I was prepared to adopt the Council\"s text. Furthermore, it is a law of physics that when the pendulum swings too far to one side, it then swings back further in the opposite direction. Dignity also means working on credibility.', '‐ Kuhn report (A4‐0224/99)', 'Breyer (V). – (DE) Madam President, naturally we fought for the Kuhn report. We would have liked to see the guarantee extended for up to five years; that would have meant that the principle of sustainability was finally also introduced de facto . It would have meant that producers would have tried to produce long‐life products. What I very much regret about the compromise is the fact that when the directives are implemented it will now be possible for the Member States to introduce a two‐month complaint period. And I will be calling on the German Government not to make use of this; indeed it has already announced that. It would be a bitter setback for consumer protection. For how can it be that someone from France, for instance, goes shopping in Germany, relies on a two‐year guarantee but then finds that because he bought the goods in Germany he should have lodged a complaint within two months?', 'I do not believe that is what we were aiming at with this report. Indeed Mrs Kuhn is just as sorry about this provision. Yet the report is a small step in the right direction. I only hope that many Member States will not make use of the possibility that has now been established of a two‐month complaint period. If they do not, the report will be a step in the right direction because it will mean that consumers can have the guarantee extended to two years. I believe it is very positive that we have also managed for the first time to establish a one‐year guarantee for second‐hand goods; that is a step towards greater sustainability and greater consumer protection. However, I hope that also means that we do not apply this two‐month complaint period, because in the case of many goods defects are only found after two months have elapsed. Then consumers would get little out of this two‐year guarantee. So I can only appeal for this not to be applied.', 'Jackson (PPE), in writing. ‐ I do not support the common position on this directive. I believe that a directive on the subject can be justified if it brings real benefits to consumers who buy goods across borders – but this directive does not do so.', 'I believe that the directive fails to deal satisfactorily with the situation where a consumer buys goods in one country, then goes home and finds that they are defective. In that situation he or she still has to return them to the place where the original purchase took place in order to obtain a refund, repair etc. It would have been far better – and have brought real benefits to consumers – if the consumer had the right to negotiate such compensation/repair etc with a representative of the company – where one exists – in his country of residence. As it is, the directive deals with this problem only through the hope, expressed in preamble 13, that producers of consumer goods marketed in several Member States will attach contact addresses in those states; there is also the prospect of future revision of the directive held out in preamble 20. The directive may well therefore raise hopes of cross‐border consumer rights that it does not fulfil.', 'Another problem with the directive is the way that it deals with second‐hand goods. Article 1, paragraph 3, allows Member States to exempt second‐hand goods sold at auction where consumers have the opportunity of attending the sale in person. But preamble paragraph 16 is very confusing: it says that the nature of second‐hand goods makes it generally impossible to replace them, so that the consumer\\'s right of replacement is generally not available for these goods. It goes on to say that for such goods Member States ‘may enable the parties to agree to a shortened period of liability\", that is shorter than 2 years.', 'I take this to mean that second‐hand goods, except those sold at auction, are covered by the directive, and that some form of consumer guarantee will have to apply to them although Member States may make it last for less than 2 years. I wonder whether the Council has appreciated the impact of this on the second‐hand market? What haggles will now take place over the ‘shortened period of liability\"? Will this kind of haggle add a new dimension to car boot sales (which are not auctions) with lawyers setting up their tables at such sales in order to resolve disputes? If the consumer\\'s right to repair etc is not ‘generally available\" in relation to second‐hand goods, will each Member State specify where it is available? If so, we will see 15 different systems springing up.', 'I await these developments with interest, but cannot give the directive my support as it stands and have therefore abstained in the final vote approving the text.', 'Titley (PSE), in writing. ‐ I will be voting today in favour of greater rights for consumers across the European Union. One of the major achievements of the European Union has been the creation of a single market in Europe encompassing over 370 million people. As a result, businesses, employees and consumers from my own constituency in the North West benefit from a market over eight times larger than the UK alone. A bigger market generates more business and more business generates more jobs.', 'Consumers benefit from more choice and more price competition. However, I want to ensure that when my constituents take advantage of the single market and buy abroad, they enjoy the same level of consumer protection as they have in Britain. I want them to have the same right to repair, replacement, reduction or refund in Milan as they have in Manchester. In short, I want to make cross‐border shoppers contented border shoppers.', 'The Labour Government has long been committed to more information for consumers, so that they can make informed choices about the products they buy, and the right to redress in case anything goes wrong. Under the British presidency, for example, we pushed through a long‐awaited agreement on consumer guarantees establishing rights for consumers when they buy goods anywhere in the single market. This is in stark contrast to the Tories, who, during the BSE crisis, brought the EU to a halt rather than provide proper protection for consumers.', '- Oomen -Ruijten Report (A4–0190/99)', 'Lindqvist (ELDR), in writing. – (SV) Distance marketing of financial services via the Internet, fax and telephone is on the increase. The Commission has submitted a proposal to improve consumer protection in relation to this distance marketing.', \"The Commission's proposal lays down firm rules from which the Member States will not be able to depart. A substantial minority in the committee supported this line. However, it would be disastrous for Sweden and other Member States. It would mean that higher standards of consumer protection could not be retained. Instead, the proposal should be based on minimum standards that would allow the Member States to retain stricter rules and to tighten up the rules if they wished to do so.\", '- Sandbæk Report (A4-0225/99)', 'Breyer (V). – (DE) Here the Green Group is of course very pleased that we have now managed to make pesticide‐free foods for babies and young children a binding requirement throughout the European Union. That is not just a great success for consumer protection but also a major contribution towards a more ecological agricultural policy. Of course it was also a major success on balance for our group, since the Greens\" amendment was the only one to obtain an absolute majority and therefore led the Commission as also the Council to shift their position. The decision to establish the precautionary principle here is groundbreaking and in our view it would now be sensible to extend it to cover schoolchildren and young people. It also means that we have to radically rethink the concept of the average individual, for this principle is based on the assumption that harmful substances are measured against an average human being weighing 80 kg. That certainly cannot protect the health of children, the frail and the old.', 'We are particularly glad that we have now managed for the first time to lay down the highest standard in the European Union in a binding way for all EU Member States, namely the zero detectability level, which de facto means organic farming, as laid down in Germany. We have shown that we do not have to dumb down harmonisation to the lowest common denominator but that it is quite possible to set a binding highest standard for all the EU Member States. We must take particular care of the youngest members of society. Here we have managed to establish the precautionary principle and we hope this will prove possible in other areas too. I see on my right my colleague Mrs Irene Soltwedel‐Schäfer, who was visited on this very day by people affected by the BSE scandal. I can only urge that if we make the precautionary principle a binding one – as we have managed here – we should also take it as our yardstick in many other areas.', '- I/US Trade disputes', 'Berthu (I‐EDN). – (FR) Madam President, the World Trade Organisation has set 13 May as the deadline for Europeans to lift the embargo they have imposed on imports of American meat that has been treated with hormones, and particularly BST.', 'The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations urges the European leaders to maintain this embargo on BST. This hormone is produced from genetically modified bacteria; it certainly has a damaging effect on the health of cattle and very probably also on the health of humans who consume the meat. We must apply the precautionary principle here, just as we should apply it to all the genetically modified organisms whose import into Europe has unwisely been authorised by the Commission.', 'But we must go even further. We must determine where the responsibilities lie in the present context and put forward proposals to correct the situation. It is important to note that the rules of international trade that are applied by the WTO and that prevent us from making proper use of the precautionary principle were ratified in the agreements concluded at the Uruguay Round by Europeans themselves; they were led astray by poor advisers, such as the European Commission, which undoubtedly was overly influenced by foreign interests.', 'That must be corrected first and foremost by way of institutional reform and at the next international negotiations. But I was truly alarmed by the fact that during the debate on Monday evening, Commissioner Brittan did not show any sign of regret and indicated that he considers the laws of free trade to be almost like divine laws, superior to all. What is even more alarming is that the President‐designate of the next Commission, Romano Prodi, stated yesterday morning in this Hemicycle that the next international negotiations should open, and I quote, ‘a further round of liberalisation\". These people have not really understood anything. With them, we are heading towards a catastrophe. Instead, what we need to do now is to establish in international trade the free choice of the people and the primacy of national sovereignty, as expressed in a democratic manner.', 'Breyer (V). – (DE) Madam President, of course we too are pleased that the EU has spoken out quite clearly in favour of maintaining the ban on hormone‐treated meat. I personally find it most regrettable that the Commission commissioned this study so late. We have known for years that there is at least one hormone that is suspected of being carcinogenic and that the other hormones have particularly adverse effects on young people during puberty. We know, and that is the crucial point, that consumers do not want hormone‐treated meat. Consumers want healthy, natural food. That is why this is a very positive decision, for it would have been a retrograde step to have simply introduced labelling, as we have sadly done in the case of novel foods even though the consumers have objected to genetically modified foods.', 'The Commission is also planning to extend the moratorium on genetically manufactured bovine growth hormones. Here too it would be high time to issue a ban, as Canada has already done. All the studies conducted by the Scientific Committee show the dangerous and explosive effects of treating animals with hormones. There are many other indications to support these findings and we must also finally get away from the situation where the WTO only addresses the question of residues, for when they decide to buy goods, consumers also have the right to object to a certain kind of production. So it is most welcome that the Commission has taken this decision; however, we should have already indicated the health hazards much more clearly and plainly in the past.', 'Graefe zu Baringdorf (V). – (DE) Madam President, let me first say how happy I am to be able to give an explanation of vote during your last part‐session as president. I was most impressed by the strength of feeling Parliament has expressed towards you. What also pleases me is the fact that this House has demanded unanimously by 525 votes – which is indeed rare – for the ban on hormone‐treated meat to be maintained. We in the Committee on Agriculture have succeeded in turning a proposal that tended towards giving preference to labelling into maintenance of the ban instead.', 'Now the scientific findings have confirmed our fears. The outcome of the decision by 525 votes will impress the Council and make it now maintain this ban on hormone‐treated meat and resume the discussions in the WTO panel, so as to make it clear that we are not in the mood to burden our people with this highly dangerous hormone‐treated meat. Many thanks and I wish you all the best!', 'President . – Thank you for those kind words, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.', 'Cunha (PPE), in writing. – (PT) In recent years we have noted that the succession of World Trade Organisation positions on matters involving trade in agricultural and food products has strangely coincided with the interests and pressure of the United States.', 'In the cases of hormone‐treated meat and the sale of seeds produced genetically – known as genetically modified organisms or GMOs – the European Union is not being allowed to respect the concerns of its consumers. Clearly this type of argument is sometimes used to conceal protectionist commercial practices. However, this is not the case with the European Union at this juncture given that BSE has severely shaken consumer confidence. This means that the European authorities are taking precautions to respect these concerns, which are more profound in Europe than in other parts of the world.', 'Indications exist of the harmful effects on health of consuming hormone‐treated meat, together with suspicions that some scientific results are being concealed from European decision‐makers. The EU must therefore remain firm in its position that all scientific data must be provided.', 'The insensitivity of the WTO in this respect confirms to us that the WTO rules on sanitary and phytosanitary protection (SPS Agreement) do not serve this purpose and must be amended at the next round of negotiations.', 'In the case of bananas, the EU is not being permitted to grant a trade concession to small countries which used to be its colonies – the ACP countries – where bananas represent the mainstay of their economies. This is particularly serious as this EU policy is included in the spirit of the Lomé Agreements which date from 1963 and which therefore significantly predate the current Multilateral Trade Agreement resulting from the Marrakesh Agreement of 1994. What is this all about? Is it because the US is a banana producer? Of course not. It is simply because the US wants to defend its companies which have a monopoly over the banana trade with their dollar bananas and which are in competition with the ACP countries.', 'Furthermore, if the WTO were to force the EU into completely liberalising the banana trade, there is absolutely no doubt that sooner or later the support system for Community banana producers would come to an end.', 'I would call on the Commission to remain firm in defence of our interests and not to be afraid to stand up to international pressures. It must take due note of all these cases in order to take the necessary precautions in the next round of WTO negotiations.', 'Kreissl‐Dörfler (V), in writing. – (DE) Ladies and gentlemen, we got the EU Commission\"s first scientific findings on hormone‐treated meat in the USA ‘just in time\". Now we have it in black and white. The hormones used on bovine animals are extremely harmful to man, especially to children. There is open talk of carcinogenic effects, of premature puberty, of immunological damage.', 'Our only answer to that must be to maintain the ban on hormone‐treated meat from the USA. Any further speculation about labelling, about compensation payments, any ideas about coming to an arrangement with the WTO rules, are simply obsolete.', 'That is also the answer I expected from Sir Leon Brittan. But I found that he did not utter a single plain word on the subject of hormones in his statement. And his view that this is primarily a legal and economic question rather than one of public health is quite outrageous and irresponsible.', 'On the contrary, the legal situation is clear, as are the economic interests. And in the interest of public health we should really call on the US Government to introduce a ban on hormone‐treated meat in the USA.', 'After bananas, hormone‐treated meat is the second source of major dispute between the USA and the EU. In the case of bananas too I emphatically ask for an end to the surrender to free‐marketeering. We must not just give in on bananas simply so as not to annoy the US Administration. We cannot take yet another step back from our development policy principles.', 'We must use the need to change our common organisation of the banana market in order to give special support to a means of production that is socially, ecologically and developmentally friendly – in every possible area. During the coming WTO round these reforms, including the reform of the GATT which is also implicated in the banana dispute, must come at the top of the agenda.', 'But we must not just wait for the outcome of that round. Here and now we must continue the EU panel against the USA\"s extra‐territorial legislation, against Section 301, and under no circumstances must we break it off. And we must take vigorous steps against the measures taken by the USA, which has de facto been imposing punitive tariffs since 3 March even though the panel\"s ruling did not come until much later.', 'It is the Commission\"s task here not to protect free trade but to protect those who suffer in the name of free trade.', 'We Greens hope that you will support the amendments to that effect that we tabled to the compromise resolution, so that we can vote for the compromise.', 'Lienemann (PSE), in writing. – (FR) Europe must be firm with the United States in the context of the transatlantic partnership. We must break away from the current thinking behind the liberalisation of trade, which does not give any consideration to social or environmental rules. We must also block the political, economic and monetary hegemony of the US, which is actually imposing the interests of American companies as if they are in the general interest.', 'The issue of hormone‐treated meat proves that health and consumer protection requirements are not being taken into account and that the precautionary principle holds little sway in the face of prevailing economic interests. Europe must continue to uphold its ban. Furthermore, the dispute over aircraft noise is evidence of their refusal to take account of our higher environmental standards.', 'The social aspect is less evident in the trade disputes. Yet unfortunately, the dominant logic today of opening up the markets, where social and environmental rules are disregarded, is systematically damaging this social aspect.', 'The banana issue reveals that the interests of multinational firms are a thousand times more important than the development of nations; the market is prevailing over the solidarity that needs to be developed within a political community.', 'It is also evident that the US agricultural trusts are making enormous profits by growing bananas in Latin America, while the people in those countries are not seeing any improvement in their situation.', 'The time has come to base the necessary international trade and liberalisation of the markets on new principles and a framework other than that decreed by the WTO, the GATT or the new transatlantic partnership.', 'Souchet (I‐EDN), in writing. – (FR) The three disputes the European Union is currently involved in with the United States in relation to the World Trade Organisation involve the banana sector, hormone‐treated meat and aircraft noise during takeoff and landing.', 'Although these three disputes only relate to a small percentage of the trade between the United States and the European Union, they are very good examples of its economic, political and social consequences.', 'In fact, as far as the banana dispute is concerned, the Member States of the European Union are losing their ability to conduct a specific and privileged policy towards certain developing countries with which we had historical links, all in the name of liberalism and the globalisation of trade. This has very significant social repercussions in some of those countries: the Member States of the European Union are following the WTO and progressively losing their sphere of influence, particularly in terms of the African continent. This is to the benefit of South America, whose agricultural resources are exploited or developed mainly by companies dominated by American capital.', 'As far as the marketing of hormone‐treated meat is concerned, there are undoubtedly repercussions that we can determine in terms of imbalances of production in an agricultural sector which, following the BSE crisis, has a structural surplus and has become much weaker. However, the consumption of hormone‐treated meat clearly has significant effects on human health, although we are not aware of their full extent. We know, for instance, that the consumption of hormone‐treated meat is damaging to the development of adolescents during puberty. The World Trade Organisation, whose rules were negotiated by the Commission and imposed on the Member States, scorns the precautionary principle and the principle of health and safety that each Member State must be able to preserve in order to protect the health of its people.', 'These two examples prove that the GATT agreements that led to the World Trade Organisation harm the interests of the people of the Member States of the European Union. I am calling for a complete reorganisation of the way in which the WTO operates, and this should take place in the context of the new round of negotiations due to begin at the end of the year. We must establish the principle of fair trade between the European Union and third countries and restore the precautionary principle. After the dispute over hormone‐treated meat, we all know that the United States will attack the European Union over genetically modified organisms.', '‐ Spencer report (A4‐0242/99)', 'McKenna (V). – Madam President, I voted against the Spencer report on the common foreign and security policy. It is just further evidence of the tendency towards militarising the European Union. This report talks about supporting the Franco‐British Declaration at St. Malo and also of the speedy integration of the Western European Union into the EU. It is quite clear the Western European Union is a military alliance. It believes in nuclear weapons and is committed to the nuclear deterrent. You would think that at the end of the 20th century we should be trying to get rid of these military blocs because they are not relevant, as far as I can see. We are breathing new life into the Western European Union, which should have actually been defunct last year.', 'In my own country we have been reassured over and over again that the European Union is not being militarised, yet many reports which have gone through this Parliament in the five years I have been here clearly indicate that is the direction it is going in. I do not believe that any kind of militarising of the EU is in the interests of the people at large, either within Europe or within the world as a whole. We are only setting up a new military bloc, which I do not believe is a good idea. Governments throughout the EU should be honest with their electorate, especially in neutral countries like my own, and say: ‘This is really what is going on here. Are you in favour of it or are you against it?\" It is quite clear that if something is not done now, at this stage, we are going to have a defence aspect to the EU. Helmut Kohl said he believed that at the end of the line to European Union lay a European army and European police force. The public has not been told this. It should be. I am fundamentally opposed to any kind of European army or European police force or to a European defence identity within the EU.', 'Caudron (PSE), in writing. – (FR) The CFSP, which was first launched by the Maastricht Treaty, has found it hard to make its mark. For too long, it was practically nonexistent and Europe has looked like a political dwarf in the international arena by adopting minimalist positions.', 'Mr Spencer\"s reports show that the European Union is beginning to assert itself as a political power, and they clearly express the European Parliament\"s desire to contribute in this area.', 'Although the European Union\"s political action is obviously still inadequate – and this is particularly evident in terms of security and defence – we must qualify this statement in light of the recent events in Kosovo. The European Union has shown that it can take initiatives, for example by organising the Rambouillet Conference. It can make its voice heard and is not playing a supporting role to the United States.', 'The Treaty of Amsterdam will enable us to give fresh impetus to the CFSP. The appointment of a High Representative for the CFSP will render this policy more visible and more effective. I support the rapporteur\"s suggestion that we should organise a hearing within the Committee on Foreign Affairs before this High Representative takes up office.', 'Moreover, the new instrument of common strategies allows us to provide the CFSP with fundamental guidelines. The General Affairs Council should adopt such a strategy with regard to the Russian Federation and submit it to the Cologne European Council. I am completely in favour of this timetable, and because this issue is so urgent, we must not postpone its adoption. The crisis the Russian Federation is currently experiencing, in institutional terms and also in economic and social terms, means that there can be no delays. The events in Kosovo should spur us on to establish intensive dialogue with the Russian Federation. It plays an essential role in the European defence structure, and this is a key element for stability in the continent of Europe.', 'The European Parliament should be consulted on the content of this strategy. Since this is not provided for in the Treaty on European Union, I hope, like the rapporteur, that an interinstitutional agreement will be drawn up to provide for this consultation. I share his indignation as regards the assessment of Parliament\"s powers in this matter. The amendments introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam do not change anything in that respect: with the exception of the financing of the CFSP, Parliament\"s role is confined to information and consultation. The presidency failed to present in time to Parliament its annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP. That is sufficient evidence that there is no desire to involve Parliament in this policy.', 'Lindqvist (ELDR), in writing. – (SV) The EU\"s common foreign and security policy has been wrecked: the United Kingdom and the USA have followed their own line more than once over Iraq, and the EU has been unable to resolve the conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo and Turkey (over Kurdistan). The EU should tone down its common foreign and security policy and instead concentrate all its energies on preventing conflict in the EU and the neighbouring regions. The CFSP should never have been established. It is misguided. The EU is not a state, and should not become one.', 'Theorin (PSE), in writing. – (SV) In my view, the EU should be built on intergovernmental cooperation. Such cooperation excludes a common defence. Consequently, there should be cross‐border cooperation to prevent conflicts.', 'Conflicts are something that humankind will have to live with – the problem is how to deal with them. Conflicts have their origins in social, ethnic and religious differences; they cannot be resolved by military power, but call for political, economic and diplomatic means instead.', 'Security can only be achieved through cooperation; everyone should enjoy the same security, which should be based on principles of equality and justice. Cooperation, openness and disarmament give us greater security, but real security must also include security from the threat of hunger, disease and oppression.', '‐ Spencer report (A4‐0219/99)', 'Blot (NI), in writing. – (FR) This report contains many good intentions and for that reason it deserves our support. However, its purpose seems somewhat pathetic.', 'The following symbolic passage is sufficient proof of this: ‘The common strategy towards Russia is being considered against a political backdrop that has changed with NATO\"s military action against the Yugoslav Federation. There is also the question of the United States Congress\"s decision to develop under certain conditions an anti‐missile defence system that, from the Russian point of view, challenges the ABM Treaty\".', 'What does our rapporteur have to say in the face of these two harmful actions by the United States? As far as he is concerned, ‘all these developments support the case for intensive dialogue between the European Union and the Russian Federation\". So on the American side, we have actions. And on the European side, we have words. There could be no clearer proof of Europe\"s powerlessness in the face of the American superpower.', 'The United States benefited so much from the division of Europe after 1945 that it seems to be doing its utmost to create the conditions for a new division, this time between Western Europe on the one hand, and Orthodox Europe on the other. There have been countless hostile acts against the Orthodox civilisation in Europe – contempt, accusations of chauvinism, total ignorance of a different culture – and the bombing of Serbia is symptomatic of this attitude. The aim is to create a new division within Europe that we would not be able to deal with in any other way. The countries of Europe must reject this logic, with the mutual support and cooperation of the Russian Federation, in the interests of peace and prosperity for all.', 'Eriksson, Sjöstedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), in writing. – (SV) We abstained in the final vote on this report. We support the line that all the EU Member States should develop and reinforce their political and economic relations with the Russian Federation, since development in Russia is important for Europe as a whole. Contributing to the improvement of democracy in Russia is central to such a strategy. However, we believe that the neo‐liberal policies encouraged by the West have played a part in creating serious social problems in Russia, such as unemployment and increasing class conflict. The fostering of relations with Russia should therefore be based on a policy which helps to strengthen democracy and reduce social inequality in that country.', 'The main theme underlying this report is that the EU should strengthen the common foreign and security policy, something we are opposed to. In our view, such a development would amongst other things lead to the non‐aligned countries – such as Sweden – becoming more dependent and having fewer opportunities to act autonomously, which would be a drawback in terms of common security in Europe and the rest of the world.', 'On the basis of the above arguments, we decided to abstain in the final vote.', '- Müller Report (A4-0227/99)', 'van Dam (I‐EDN), in writing. – (NL) Mrs Müller has drawn up an excellent report on the budget estimates for 2000. We are happy to adopt many of its recommendations and therefore voted in favour of it. The rapporteur is right to go for a strict budgetary policy. It must only be possible to take on extra staff in specifically justified cases. The buildings must be paid off over the shortest possible period of time in order to keep interest payments to a minimum. The rapporteur also rejects direct subsidies out of the EU budget for setting up and operating a supermarket and the catering services in the Parliament buildings. These are all recommendations which we firmly support.', 'I would, however, like to raise a number of questions. We support the move to a new personnel policy under which promotion would be performance based. This encourages motivation. But the big question here is who judges this performance? Can we guarantee that the appraisal will be objective? We must do away with favouritism and political appointments based on personal preference. The Santer Commission came to grief as a result of cronyism. Let this serve as an example to others.', 'Finally, I should like to say a word about the salaries of Community officials. If a statute is accepted for Members of Parliament, there will be a huge discrepancy between the salary levels of MEPs and officials. Not that we as MEPs should be dissatisfied. But it does indicate that the salaries paid to officials are excessive. This is something we need to debate.', '(The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR D. MARTIN\\nVice‐President']}, {'topic': '8. Agenda 2000 (continuation)', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on Agenda 2000.', 'Hänsch (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is and has been the wish of the Council, the Commission and Parliament to achieve three objectives by means of Agenda 2000. The first is to make the Union fit for enlargement eastwards. The second is to reform its own policies, especially its agricultural and Structural Funds policies, in a sense to bring a breath of fresh air into our policies. The third is to safeguard the financing of these policies over the next seven years.', 'The master plan presented by the Commission to this end did not come through the more than two years of discussions in Parliament and the Council unchanged, and I admit that this was not advantageous in every respect. It will become apparent that we have not entirely achieved the objectives I have just listed. But it is also true that we have come very, very close to doing so.', 'The result of Berlin is a compromise. That it came into being at all is also thanks to the German Presidency of the Council, and in particular to the German Chancellor. Every compromise, including of course the Berlin compromise, has some more and some less satisfactory aspects. Perhaps in the European Union maximum satisfaction can be achieved only if the dissatisfaction is equally distributed. Here too the German Presidency can boast some success. But so can Parliament! Never before has the European Parliament been so closely involved in the decision‐making on a reform project of this scale.', 'From the time of the first reading of the reports in the European Parliament up to the Berlin European Council at the end of March, Parliament influenced and modified the results in the course of intensive discussions, and in intensive negotiations after Berlin. This result is certainly not quite what we had hoped and wanted. However, we are also aware that for the first time the European Parliament has managed to change important aspects of a European Council decision. We succeeded in ensuring the implementation and funding of a fourth URBAN Community initiative, so as to promote the economic and social regeneration of cities and urban neighbourhoods.', 'I want to take this opportunity to particularly thank the Commissioner, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, for supporting the European Parliament\"s position on these questions, as also on a range of others. We would not have carried off this success without having her on our side.', 'It will be thanks to us if more attention is paid in future to land‐use planning, to remote regions and islands. It will be thanks to us that more support is to be given to education and training, and above all it is thanks to us that the flexibility instrument can be increased. Also to our credit is the review clause for the financing of future policies, especially in the external policy area and in relation to aid for the reconstruction of the afflicted Balkan regions. It is thanks to us that codecision has been introduced at least in some areas of agricultural policy. I think the future President of the Commission has us to thank that this Commission will have considerably more staff available for carrying out new tasks than the old Commission ever had.', 'The large majority of my group will approve the interinstitutional agreement on medium‐term financial planning and we will of course give our assent to those parts of Agenda 2000 that require such assent.', 'As we declared back in November 1998: we, the Parliament, will do all we can to ensure that the Agenda 2000 package is adopted before Parliament is re‐elected and we want to get this Agenda 2000 under way now. It makes a vital contribution to the Union\"s ability to act during a difficult period. With our decisions on Agenda 2000 we will make the European Union more able to move into the future.', 'Hatzidakis (PPE), rapporteur. – (EL) Mr President, in an era when the dogma that you can implement policies, especially social policies, without money is increasingly gaining ground, I continue to insist on the need for a substantive policy of economic and social cohesion within the framework of the European Union. Social and economic cohesion is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on European Union and I think that all the institutions of the European Union must remain firmly committed to this fundamental principle.', 'I have to say that, within this framework, the Commission proposals on Agenda 2000 were a step in the right direction. I would like, on behalf of the Group of the European People\"s Party, to congratulate Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, Mr Fischler and Mr Flynn on their position throughout the negotiations.', 'As we all know, the European Parliament formalised its proposals as far back as November, and I believe that it went much further than the Commission proposals. What it set out to do was to bring together two objectives: on the one hand to have effective fund management and, on the other, to place the emphasis where it was needed. This is why we asked from the outset that three quarters of the funds went to Objective 1 regions, which are the poorest.', 'Taking this a step further, Mr President, negotiations took place and then we had the European Council meeting in Berlin, until which time there had been a certain indecisiveness. Fortunately, however, the European Council in Berlin reached a compromise, which was followed by negotiations between Parliament, the Council and, of course, the Commission. This brought about three constructive changes: the first change concerned the Community initiative, URBAN; the second was the European Regional Development Fund relating to actions for culture and tourism, and the third concerned the special emphasis given, again under the European Regional Development Fund, to islands.', 'As with all compromises, the compromise reached at Berlin does not give cause for celebration, even less so for my country – and I must speak as a Greek – since the Greek Government accepted reforms which place us in the same category as Spain, Ireland and Portugal, countries which are less poor than ours and which are already participating in the euro.', 'Nevertheless, if Parliament were to reject this compromise, all our efforts would go up in smoke, and it would prevent the timely onset of programmes within the third Community support framework on 1 January 2000. I move therefore that the regulation be adopted, especially now that most of the opinions expressed by Parliament as far back as November have been accepted, and that we achieved positive changes during the negotiations we had with the Council last month.', 'I would also like to say a few words about the pre‐accession funds. It is sad that Cyprus has been excluded by the Council. Cyprus is the only applicant country that has been excluded from pre‐accession funding. I hope that Mr van den Broek will fulfil his commitment to examine the possibility of a special budget line to fund Cyprus, as we cannot have double standards. Such exclusions give rise to doubts as to whether there is indeed the will to admit Cyprus into the European Union, and these doubts must be dispelled as quickly as possible.', 'Brinkhorst (ELDR). – Mr President, when the European Council in Berlin reached an agreement, the most important thing was that there was a political agreement. At that time it was unacceptable for Parliament. But at this historic moment we will hopefully agree to an interinstitutional agreement. It is historic in that never before has the European Council position been changed by Parliament and it reflects our new position. We see in front of us three of the resigning Commissioners, and I should like to say on this point that the original proposals on Agenda 2000 showed courage and vision on the part of the Commission. The results of the European Council were not satisfactory.', 'We have achieved major results. Above all, for the first time we now have new rights in terms of non‐compulsory expenditure on agriculture. That must surely be something positive for Commissioner Fischler. We have received new guarantees of new flexibility. We are not very satisfied by the fact that the Council has cut down enormously in an area where this Parliament has major rights – Category 3. At least we have achieved within the current constraints the possibility of a further adjustment by Parliament.', 'In Category 4 – external policy – there is an agreement that we will have the possibility of review. The hypocrisy of the European Council can best be demonstrated by the fact that no less than EUR 250 m had to be decided within two weeks on Kosovo, thereby taking more than three‐fifths of the overall basis for seven years. It shows therefore that Berlin is already outdated. But voting against an interinstitutional agreement at this moment would be a major mistake. It is on that basis that the Liberal Group will vote for the interinstitutional agreement because it will achieve not simply more money but more rights and more parity. It is on that basis that the European Community can move forwards. If we vote against it, with all the other difficulties, we would throw the European Union into a major phase of uncertainty at the time that the challenges for the new century are about to come.', 'Baggioni (UPE). – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the islanders of the European Union were pleased to see on the evening of 2 October 1997 that the Treaty of Amsterdam signed by the 15 Member States contained the first explicit references officially recognising the permanent and structural handicaps suffered by the island regions and the need to remedy this situation.', 'Unfortunately, less than two years later and with the Treaty having entered into force last Saturday, it is important to note that the reform of the Structural Funds for the 2000‐2006 period does not follow the same logic as the new Treaty. Although a solid legal basis allowed us to implement a truly integrated policy to help the island regions, particularly by means of the Structural Funds, the Council and the Commission decided otherwise, paying no heed to the European Parliament\"s recommendations in this matter. The island regions saw all the possibilities of special, specific treatment being categorically and methodically rejected. Even the modest request for a special section for cooperation with and between the islands in the Interreg III programme was rejected.', 'On reading the regulations that will be adopted tomorrow, it would seem that the cause of the island regions will not have made any significant advances with this reform of the Structural Funds. Moreover, it is worrying to note that, from the year 2000, very few islands will be considered to be in need of support as a result of their slow development. Does this mean that the Council and the Commission believe that the Union\"s island regions have experienced enough economic development to call into question the political will – set out a year and a half earlier at the Amsterdam Council – to give real consideration to the islands\" problems? Does this mean that the permanent and structural handicaps that were expressly recognised have disappeared as if by magic in only 18 months? Only the regulation concerning the ERDF refers to the need to help certain islands, and even then it only contains a very vague reference.', 'Nevertheless, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Varela, and the members of the Committee on Regional Policy for their understanding and their support throughout this parliamentary term. Faced with such an inadequate outcome for the cause of the islands, there is no doubt that all efforts must now be made to ensure that the specific characteristics of the Union\"s island regions are considered not only in theoretical terms, but also in practical terms. But I trust that the European Parliament will continue along the path it has followed for several years. The Council and the Commission will not be able to pretend for ever that they do not hear us.', 'Miranda (GUE/NGL). – (PT) Mr President, the framework for the financial perspective agreed in Berlin is not likely to raise much enthusiasm. This is probably not due so much to the amounts earmarked for or requested from each of our countries, but more to the generally restrictive solution adopted and its precariousness. Nevertheless, all the countries and governments declared that they were winners after the summit. But we should be objective. With such a financial framework, there will be no enlargement until 2006. In order to achieve this before then, the perspective will have to be extensively reweighted, as well as the respective amounts.', 'This medium‐term financial framework does not respond to such important issues as the consolidation of the euro and, in particular, any asymmetric shocks or other shocks which may result from the next WTO negotiations. In this context, although we are happy to unconditionally support and encourage the new interinstitutional agreement as a matter of principle and in order to guarantee stability and allow planning, the resulting compromise of the financial framework adopted with these characteristics gives us cause for concern. This will increase even more due to the absence of an in‐depth reform of the CAP, which we recommend, and due to the undeniably restrictive content of the rules which will govern some of the cohesion‐related instruments. However, other members of my group will talk about these aspects.', 'Schroedter (V). – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me turn to the positive aspects. It is vitally important to economic and social cohesion and therefore to the very core of the European social model that the new regulation was adopted in good time, before the end of the European Parliament\"s electoral term. That guarantees the continuation of the funding. However, the price is very high. The regions will now have to compensate for the financial cuts at the very heart of European integration by putting forward more intelligent plans. In this regard I call on the Commission to apply its control function really seriously and genuinely to pursue in its programmes the objectives formulated in the new regulation – sustainable development, promotion of employment, promotion of equal opportunities for women and men, environmental improvement, support for small and medium‐sized undertakings – and not to shy away from them again in face of the Member States. The result of Berlin, as has already been said today, is not quite the reform we hoped for. After Parliament increased the rights of the people of Europe by incorporating a comprehensive principle of participation in the draft regulation – and this is the only basis for sustainable planning – the Council is now leaving this common concern to the discretion of the Member States. I regard that as the main problem with the new regulation.', 'When the funds are used for integrated development plans, the traditional way of thinking in terms of resources must be overcome. The regulation does offer possibilities, but I have since become aware of the resistance at Member State level. What this means is that local development initiatives must obtain ESF and ERDF funds if they really are to be able to combat unemployment. Under the new Structural Funds regulation it has proved possible to continue the cohesion policy. But that is not a reform! Efficiency, administrative simplification and concentration have fallen by the wayside. They were sacrificed to the confessional procedure and the favours handed out there.', 'I conclude from this that if we do not finally manage to place the European interest above national interests we will not manage to achieve a genuinely progressive economic and social cohesion policy.', 'Barthet‐Mayer (ARE). – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a consensus within Parliament as regards the enlargement of the EU to include the CEECs and the need to reform the CAP, and I would like to look at this aspect of Agenda 2000. Parliament, which represents the people of Europe, stated that it was in favour of the European agricultural model, greater equity, balanced rural development, improved quality and the protection of the environment. This was highlighted in the Cunha report.', 'This political position is clear and it totally opposes the ever‐increasing standardisation, the ever‐increasing homogenisation, and the ever‐increasing relentless competition, which pushes farmers\" prices and incomes down. This is the ultra‐liberal position of the Cairns Group and the United States. Thanks to Parliament\"s firm stance, which has meant that the Commission has had to take up a less intransigent position, and thanks to the perseverance and persistence of certain Member States, we have a satisfactory compromise for the short‐term in terms of abandoning cofinancing, in terms of a more moderate fall than expected in guaranteed agricultural prices and in terms of the status quo on quotas.', 'But what will happen in the future? Does the reform enable us to respond to the Commission\"s plans for sustainable agriculture, which contradict its amended proposal on the agricultural section of Agenda 2000? Is cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries enhanced? Has rural development, which involves 80\\u2009% of the Union\"s territory, been given the role it deserves? Is it promoted in the island regions and allocated greater resources in the budget? Are the issues of the obvious social and environmental imbalances in the CAP and the division of agriculture into two categories truly resolved? Is aid to agriculture better distributed and does it better protect the environment? No, no, no and no.', 'By moving away from the policy of supporting agriculture through prices, by shrinking into ourselves and encouraging nationalisation, by undermining this sector through a further increase in direct income aid, Europe is moving further and further away from its mission and the founding principles of the common agricultural market. What is even more serious is that it is eroding the foundations of its culture, its countryside, its gastronomy, and therefore a major part of its identity. How will the agricultural Europe, reformed in this way, be able to defend its political project for agriculture and rural development in the future WTO negotiations? This gives rise to great concern.', 'Those negotiating on behalf of Europe in the WTO will have to prepare for battle and put our minds at rest: the European Union must never have a political agricultural objective of bringing the Community\"s regulations into line with the rules of play of the global market. For the time being, since it is the present we must deal with, my group will vote in favour of the current compromise, but it urges the Commission to defend the European agricultural model at the next WTO negotiations.', 'des Places (I‐EDN). ‐ (FR) Mr President, it is on the strength of our convictions rather than any desire to put up opposition that we will not vote for the legislative resolutions on Agenda 2000, with the exception of the resolution on the COM in wine, as we do not support the positions of the Commission and the Council that emerged as a result of the Berlin compromise.', 'How could we be pleased with an agreement that leads to a significant reduction in European farmers\" incomes, through a partially compensated reduction in prices, before totally eliminating them to satisfy the requirements of the WTO? You will be aware, Mr President, that certain agricultural products are essential for the environmental balance and for the utilisation of EU territory. Unfortunately, a serious decline will be experienced as far as certain products are concerned. I am thinking, in particular, of oil protein crops, which, I would remind you, are ideal rotation crops to produce quality cereals, something we are increasingly trying to do.', 'When I drafted the two opinions of the Committee on Agriculture on Agenda 2000, I warned all my colleagues about the budget difficulties we would encounter. In this connection, I am for the most part satisfied with the Berlin agreement with respect to its aim to support, if need be, the agricultural guideline as and when the successive enlargements take place, taking into consideration an automatic annual technical adjustment in the financial perspective to account for inflation. We only hope that the principle of compulsory expenditure will not be called into question.', 'Apart from its repercussions on farmers\" incomes, this agreement in no way prepares for the next WTO negotiations, or perhaps, without saying so, it prepares for them too well. All the proposed reforms will be given a pounding. The only acquis that our partners will accept is the reduction of prices.', 'Clearly, our partners are also going to try to dismantle compensation aid. We all know that the motto in these types of negotiations is that everything that has been established has been established while the rest is up for negotiation. European agriculture must not disappear. Besides the economic and financial role that farmers play, they also have a social, cultural and environmental role that must be given top priority. On listening to Mr Prodi\"s speeches, I noticed that he plans to use his position to enhance the role of the European Union in urban areas.', 'So allow me to ask one question: in this context, where does the future of the countryside lie with the development of the Structural Funds to benefit urban areas, with the new WTO negotiations and with a CAP that contradicts our European identity?', \"President . – That concludes the political group spokemen's contribution. We now come to the contributions of the rapporteurs.\", 'McCarthy (PSE), rapporteur. ‐ Mr President, above all we need to be aware here today of our responsibilities in Parliament\\'s final part‐session, not only our legislative function but our commitment to deliver this new round of European funds for our regions and local communities in a timely manner. As rapporteur I would like to tell you why I am recommending that Parliament gives a resounding ‘Yes\" vote to the Council regulation on structural funds as amended. Our objective has been to emphasise Parliament\\'s priorities in the reform process through a succession of informal contacts. This informal procedure is an ongoing exchange of information, a fruitful dialogue which has resulted in Parliament\\'s priorities being incorporated into the final Berlin text while some demands remain to be negotiated in post‐Berlin meetings.', 'We can be satisfied that key priorities have been met. Parliament requested that concentration must ensure that Objective 1 regions, the poorest in the Union, continue to receive priority assistance. This is the case in areas such as my own in Merseyside with a GDP of less than 75\\u2009% of the EU average which will continue to receive priority funds. I have to say that even if some financial special cases were made alongside Objective 1, this was of course the price to pay for a package and financial deal. We have to have the realism and pragmatism in this Parliament to recognise that consensus and compromise are the lifeblood of European politics.', \"New Objective 2 regions will continue to benefit from a sustained European commitment and sustained investment. Again, if I look to my own region of the North‐West, it has benefited from European funding. There is still a lot to do and we are glad to see the flexibility of a six‐year potential phasing‐out programme rather than four years in the Commission's original proposal. I would like to invite the Commission at the end of our mandate to take up the offer from Manchester City Council to come and see how European funds are making a difference to local communities there.\", 'We supported a safety net proposal. This we believe was a success. In addition, Parliament very much welcomes the request, that was met, for the Union to play an active role in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. This was met with a special peace package.', \"We would have liked to have gone further on partnership but we hope that Member States will have the vision to ensure wide and deeper partnership in the drafting of programmes and in the implementing of those programmes. Most importantly, for me personally, the jewel in the crown achieved as a result of informal post‐Berlin negotiations in Strasbourg was that the Council agreed to the European Parliament's request to modify the Berlin Summit decision to add a new URBAN initiative with 0.35\\u2009% of funds added to the Community pot. I hope Mr Flynn does not think we are plundering Article 10 because we will be using those funds for social and employment initiatives as well.\", 'URBAN has been popular with the public in some of our most deprived neighbourhoods and I believe we can help those communities on the path to regeneration. The rapporteurs therefore recommend that we now see a balance of interest between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I would warn any political group that is thinking of playing party politics with this vote that blocking these proposals would mean a newly elected Parliament would be unable to vote until autumn, and this would put at risk over 200 billion of resources and involve interminable delays to local communities and projects.', 'But let us be clear about what we are voting for today. This is not just a 112‐page document of Eurospeak and technical details, although you can find plenty of Eurojargon in it. It is a package of funding to launch our regions into the new millennium, seven years of support for our most marginalised communities and areas who need our European commitment and solidarity, for the young, the long‐term unemployed and women returners: people who want to play an active role and part in economic regeneration in Europe. This is a European Union package for jobs, for regeneration. It is an employment and regeneration pact and it is a product of a consensus and compromise between the Member States.', 'As I have said, we believe we have made very positive improvements with the addition of a fourth Community initiative, a new URBAN initiative, which Parliament supported and campaigned for. For all the above reasons I urge members today to use their vote to give a unanimous ‘Yes\" vote to this funding package. Let us give our EU citizens the visible sign that we are backing the solidarity and support needed for the jobs and regeneration programmes for the new millennium', 'Collins, Gerard (UPE), rapporteur. ‐ Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present the recommendation and the report on the Cohesion Fund, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy.', 'When I presented this report for a first reading last November I spoke about the need for social and economic cohesion to remain one of the central pillars of the Community. The Cohesion Fund has been one of the clearest examples of this solidarity and action and what it can achieve. In approving this report on that occasion this House endorsed that view of the Community.', \"In recent months, and indeed up to the Berlin Summit, there have been a number of meetings with the Council on the future of the Cohesion Fund. I was adamant to negotiate the retention of the Cohesion Fund and that it be maintained in its current form. The final agreement at Berlin upheld Parliament's views in relation to the Fund and points raised during the informal conciliation period were taken on board.\", \"Parliament's priorities in relation to the Cohesion Fund were easily identifiable. The first priority was to ensure the continuation of the Fund and the Council was able to agree with Parliament's view that the basic objectives of the Cohesion Fund are as relevant today as they were in 1992. Therefore the eligibility criterion of 90\\u2009% of the Union average wealth had to remain unchanged, allowing Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to continue to qualify for the fund.\", 'The view shared by Parliament and the Commission that the four current cohesion countries should continue to be eligible was agreed to by Council. The countries concerned need to continue the convergence process, and the continuation of the Fund is a vital ingredient in this process.', 'The retention of the fund under the same conditions means that the infrastructure gap between the four cohesion countries and the rest of the Community can gradually be closed. It is vital that the current imbalance in this area be redressed so as to allow for a harmonised level of economic development across the EU.', \"A second point on which Parliament's views were taken on board, relates to the amount of an advance for projects and Parliament believed that the 10\\u2009% on account proposed by the Commission was insufficient. It would have exerted too heavy a burden on less‐favoured regions trying to get a project off the ground, and the 20\\u2009% agreed at Berlin, I believe, recognised this fact.\", 'A further issue which Parliament had deemed unsatisfactory was the application of the ‘polluter pays\" principle. While we naturally supported the idea, the Commission proposal remained unclear as to what was meant by ‘a project\\'s capacity to generate revenue\". Clear guidelines were needed as to the practical implementation of the principle. In this respect I welcome the Commission\\'s declaration attached to the Berlin conclusions that the implementation would have to take account of national, social sensitivities.', 'In terms of what Parliament set out to achieve for the Cohesion Fund from 2000 to 2006, the Berlin agreement is highly satisfactory. For this reason I believe there is no need for any further adjustments. I will just outline some of the main features of the Cohesion Fund as it will be under the amended regulation from the year 2000.', 'There will be an overall amount of EUR 18 billion available to the four cohesion countries for the seven year period. The allocation of the total resources between the four countries was made on the basis of precise and objective criteria, principally population size and GNP per capita. Account was taken of the improvement and national prosperity attained over the previous period as well as of surface area. Other factors, such as deficiencies and transport infrastructure were also considered. And halfway through the funding period a review of progress will take place to see which countries will continue to qualify on the basis of continuing to meet the 90\\u2009% criterion.', 'As I have already mentioned, the ‘polluter pays\" principle is included in the amended regulation and other environmental considerations also feature. In this way Parliament\\'s view that infrastructure development must take serious account of environmental obligations is clearly evident.', 'Colleagues, we all took a very close interest in the Berlin Summit and are all well aware that the final agreement did not come easily. The question of the Cohesion Fund was frequently controversial and, against this background, Parliament can be satisfied that it was taken seriously by the other institutions and that our recommendations were taken on board.', \"I welcome the final text of the regulation as one that reflects very clearly Parliament's views and I recommend that colleagues give this report their assent. This will consolidate many months of dedicated effort from Parliament's side to secure the best deal possible for the balanced development of our regions and the furthering of economic and social cohesion of the European Union. Parliament's assent will mean that the funding timetable can be adhered to in vital projects in Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, enabling them to call down the necessary funding. These projects will make a real and tangible difference to the lives of millions of our citizens living in the Community's more remote and under‐developed regions.\", 'But the Cohesion Fund is more than this. Its benefits are not limited to four Member States. In building the Union into a more cohesive, economic Union we are consolidating the single market and reinforcing the euro. We are allowing the Union to face up to not only these current projects but also the future ambition of enlargement. It is true that the Cohesion Fund is limited as to its sectors of operation, geographical focus and indeed amounts. However, it has proven to be an excellently focused instrument recording excellent expenditure levels and results which are of benefit to all.', \"In conclusion, Mr President, on a personal note, I should like to sincerely thank Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies for her very positive role in this area. She has always been most open at all times to discussion and debate, always understanding, always courteous to Parliament's members of the Committee on Regional Policy. Her commitment to the European Union and to her area of responsibility is an inspiration to us all.\", 'Varela Suanzes‐Carpegna (PPE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur, I am very pleased for two reasons. Firstly, Parliament has the chance to approve tomorrow in the House our recommendation at second reading concerning the ERDF. This has important legal and political implications since, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the ERDF now comes under the codecision procedure. We have had the novel experience of negotiating with the Council and the Commission in order to find a consensus between Parliament\"s position, that of the 15 Member States and the Commission\"s proposal.', 'One slip by Parliament, or simply one occasion where we do not exercise our powers responsibly, could result in us approving certain amendments that might prevent us from concluding this important regulation tomorrow, thereby preventing the regions of Europe from planning their activities for 1 January 2000.', 'I am also very pleased as rapporteur because of the content of the document we have drawn up. It was not easy to fully explain our colleagues\" ideas, but through four compromise amendments we succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the majority to withdraw other amendments, while also managing to preserve the spirit of our committee\"s proposal.', 'The first of these four amendments refers to the inclusion of the concept of land‐use planning in the ERDF, which is something Parliament has been fighting for for quite some time. We need to link regional development with spatial development. Or, if you prefer, we need to unite economic and social cohesion with the territorial cohesion of Europe.', 'Our second compromise amendment is very closely related to land‐use planning and calls on the ERDF to help establish the necessary links with regions suffering from permanent, geographical disadvantages because of their peripheral or insular status. The aim here is to promote exchanges between Europe\"s peripheral areas and the Community\"s central regions. In its three‐yearly report on cohesion, the Commission has highlighted the fact that this situation is one of the main reasons for the backwardness of these regions and a factor in any eventual recovery.', 'Our third compromise amendment specifically brings tourism and culture under the scope of the ERDF. Not long ago, just before he unfortunately passed away, the artist and humanist Yehudi Menuhin wondered publicly what would happen to the European Union\"s culture. Strangely, although 80\\u2009% of the Union\"s spending on culture comes from the Structural Funds, only 3\\u2009% of its appropriations are allocated to cultural projects. Our report hopes to provide a response to these questions and we would ask that culture be given a greater presence in the Structural Funds, including our cultural and natural heritage.', 'Finally, in line with the report on the general regulation, we would ask that the URBAN initiative should be maintained alongside the Community\"s Interreg initiative.', 'I would like to end by referring to a very special issue in which the European Parliament has played a very significant role: the structural aspects of fisheries. In my speech to the House at first reading, I called on the Commission to amend its proposal and put fisheries on an equal footing with agriculture. I am pleased to see today that our position – which was so strongly defended by our rapporteur, Mr Arias Cañete, under the firm and constant guidance of the Committee on Fisheries – has reached a satisfactory conclusion. The amendments Parliament had requested have been introduced and we have managed to end up with a report that is a significant improvement on the Commission\"s proposal.', 'I would therefore like to thank the Commission, the Council and all our colleagues who have supported us.', 'Jöns (PSE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it seems hard to believe: the Social Fund is our only labour market policy instrument at European level! It has very successfully introduced new labour market policy measures in the Member States. Yet in Berlin it was not provided with anything near the funding that this House and the Commission rightly called for. Precisely in the case of the Social Fund, which has repeatedly produced European added value, whether in regard to the policy for the handicapped, in regard to preventive labour market policy or, for instance, to promoting equal opportunities for women, much remained in dispute up the last minute. Surely that is a rather topsy‐turvy world! It was not our fault. We did not call for anything revolutionary. Basically we were concerned with five key points to effectively flank the common employment strategy. Right at the top of the list was a preventive labour market policy and specific measures for women. Preventing unemployment has to be the more humane approach and is also considerably cheaper. Surely it is not acceptable that people now speak of the feminisation of poverty Union‐wide! Nor is it acceptable that EU‐wide women only occupy 3\\u2009% of top jobs, and the rate is declining. Women still make up the majority of the population. And here, gentlemen of the Council, mainstreaming alone is not enough!', 'We were also concerned with doing more to combat social marginalisation, for in the long term it will pay off if these people can manage to support themselves again. We also wanted to make the positive experiences gained from the PEACE initiative accessible throughout the Union; under this initiative, NGOs provided small grants that did not involve any great administrative outlay to help people for whom access to public sector jobs represents an impossible threshold to cross.', 'Our fifth concern was to make the Member States more aware of the need to cover all the Social Fund intervention areas rather than just picking out their favourites again. And let me say again to the Council: you have been aware of these demands since the beginning of the year. But that did not stop you from deciding your common position with quite stubborn disregard for this. We may well ask ourselves in this House, what is the point then of these informal conciliation meetings? The fact that we now have compromises acceptable to both sides is thanks to us and us alone, because we openly came towards you with compromise proposals to prevent your stubborn attitude from driving us to the Conciliation Committee; for that would have meant having to stall many projects because the money would not have come from Brussels in time. That would have been irresponsible, which, I hope, is something nobody here in this House wants!', 'In the end you got round to it after all. Even if the percentages of the funding have not been fixed, we have agreed on a more preventive labour market policy and on more specific measures for women. Suddenly it did prove possible to enshrine in the regulation the objective of social integration in the labour market. In the end we even managed to reach a compromise on global subsidies, which now actually makes it possible to provide up to 100\\u2009% support for NGOs.', 'The amendments we have now agreed with the Council are Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9 and 10. I would ask all Members to support these amendments so that the results of our negotiations are also reflected in the Social Fund regulation.', 'There has been very little shift in the Council\"s position on the five intervention areas. We will have to learn to live with that. But on no issue was the Council as inflexible and stubborn as on mainstreaming. So it is now up to the Commission to ensure that mainstreaming is incorporated in the national programmes. I hope we will also see a few women in the Council in seven years\" time. It would certainly be a service to the cause!', 'Arias Cañete (PPE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the first report I presented to the House on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the Council Regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, Parliament expressed its support for three basic ideas. The first was the need to guarantee sufficient resources in the Community budget to cover the sector\"s needs in the context of the structural policy for the fisheries sector. The second was the need for a single legal framework, in the form of a horizontal regulation, that would bring together the various regulations. The third was the need for national programmes, and not only regional programmes, to guarantee that the structural policy was consistent with the fleets\" multi‐annual guidance programmes.', 'On the basis of this strategy, at first reading Parliament brought together in a single regulation both the proposal for a Council Regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, which is included in Agenda 2000, and the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. The vote in the House entirely endorsed the positions supported by the Committee on Fisheries. Subsequently, our committee, and particularly its chairman, Carmen Fraga, contacted the Council, the national administrations and the professional organisations to organise a public hearing, which confirmed that Parliament\"s political position was widely supported.', 'With such support, Parliament held various informal meetings with the Council presidency which, I am very pleased to say, has agreed to most of what we wanted, and, since the Berlin European Council, a new proposal for a regulation has even been drawn up, which is at last known as the ‘Regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance\".', 'From now on, we will have a single structural basis for fisheries and will not have to finance structural measures under the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Equally, we will have horizontal programming in non‐Objective 1 regions. We will also have a full list of all the actions and measures involved, and on the basis of these concessions from the Council, the Committee on Fisheries has accepted that there will two separate regulations.', 'I would like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the flexibility they demonstrated in reviewing the initial ideas we considered to be mistaken and looking for a satisfactory compromise.', 'I would also like to point out that we have made significant changes to the regulation on implementing measures: we have removed the additional 30\\u2009% requirement for capacity withdrawn and the arrangements linking joint enterprises to the fisheries agreements.', 'I would like to end with a general reference to the Structural Funds pillar of Agenda 2000. In my view, given the backdrop of budgetary rigour, the Council and the Commission have shown good sense in concentrating aid on Objective 1 regions. This will allow us to maintain the current levels of support in terms of per capita aid and to maintain the Cohesion Fund. Together, these elements will help us to speed up the structural recovery of the less prosperous countries.', 'There is no doubt that our structural policy lacks vital weight to overcome the regional imbalances in the short term. By the same token, however, there is no doubt that the European Union is continuing to preserve some extremely important solidarity mechanisms. Perhaps, against this backdrop of budgetary rigour, we can see the importance of the requirement set out in the Treaty that all Community policies – not only structural policies – must be considered from the perspective of economic and social cohesion.', 'It may be that in a situation where the debate on net balances determines the solutions, it is somewhat utopian to demand that all Community policies should be aimed at achieving greater economic and social cohesion. But in the near future, when we tackle the question of enlargement, we will have to look at this idea in greater detail if we do not want to end up with an enlarged Europe with even greater regional disparities that put the entire system at risk.', 'Barón Crespo (PSE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will try to help the President by speaking slowly, if possible, and without a text in front of me.', 'Up until now, we have talked about how we are going to put our common house – the Union – in order. It is now time to look at enlargement. This report of mine which is now at second reading discusses the coordination of pre‐accession aid for enlargement. I feel that I should remind you briefly of the historical task and role of enlargement, not only in terms of Agenda 2000 but also for the European Union. The people of Central and Eastern Europe and of the Mediterranean, the majority of whom have only recently regained their freedom, want to take part in our common historic adventure.', 'Since the beginning, Parliament has stated that, in its view, there should be a general process of negotiation involving inclusive criteria, without the creation of new barriers and new discriminations and with the possibility of a fairly competitive environment. In other words, we hoped that each and every one of these countries could make the collective effort to restore democracy, restructure their economies and learn to live in harmony with their neighbours that should enable them to participate fully in our future.', 'I have drawn up this report on behalf of Parliament and in close cooperation with my colleagues Mr Walter and Mr Sonneveld, and my aim has been to coordinate the aid and to also include Parliament\"s criteria.', 'I must say, Mr President, that we have succeeded in a series of important objectives in this area. Firstly, the Commission itself mended its own ways: it amended its initial draft and even changed the title of the regulation as we had requested. Moreover, between the two readings, we held a series of meetings with the Council presidency which, in my view, were quite positive and enabled us to develop the criteria relating to the implementation of the PHARE programme, which is vitally important for organising and strengthening the institutions in these countries and including political criteria relating to democracy and strengthening civil society. In short, it is fundamental for helping to strengthen these societies. This is the first objective which, in my opinion, we have managed to modify and improve compared with the initial proposal.', 'We have also made significant progress in other areas, such as respect for the existing comitology rules. We wanted to ensure that these rules were not changed by any underhand methods. Furthermore, we made progress in terms of Parliament\"s participation, as there is now the possibility that we might be able to review this process every year. Overall, I feel that the solution is satisfactory.', 'Naturally, there are some issues that have yet to be resolved and I believe they should be mentioned. One of these, which relates to the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is my belief – which did not receive the support of the House, but now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force it is assuming great importance – that we should look at this entire process as an overall strategy for the Union that should lead to joint measures. In my view, this would also allow us to integrate the policy that we need to develop in this area into our legal and constitutional framework.', 'There is another issue that should be mentioned, which it was not officially included but was incorporated in the procedures involving each of the countries. It relates to the importance we attach to social dialogue in relation to strengthening the system of production and industrial relations in these countries.', 'I would like to mention two other aspects of our approach that have yet to be resolved, although the Council confirms that they are being considered. One of these is the importance of restructuring the nuclear industry in most of the countries concerned. This is an extremely sensitive issue for most of the Union\"s citizens. And the final aspect – which we hope will also be integrated in the future under the new Commission – relates to the behavioural criteria and the code of conduct that must follow. I hope that these two issues can be resolved as quickly as possible.', 'Sonneveld (PPE), rapporteur. – (NL) Mr President, I am going to speak about pre‐accession measures for agriculture. In our first report we included a fundamental point concerning the conditions which the Commission proposed applicant countries should fulfill in order to qualify for EU farming subsidies. I am referring here to the condition that applicant countries must have drawn up a seven‐year rural development plan by 1 January 2000. The European Parliament amended this requirement, considering it much too demanding, and proposed a more practical procedure. The Council, however, decided to follow the Commission proposal.', 'This point was repeatedly on the agenda at the subsequent trialogue meetings, and the Council presidency in particular expressed understanding for the European Parliament\"s objections. Nevertheless, we did not succeed in convincing the Commission and Council that this condition would place an excessive administrative burden on the applicant countries. The Council was prepared, however, to abandon the date of 1 January, while maintaining the year 2000. As a result, the difference of opinion in principle with the European Parliament remained unchanged.', 'The European Parliament believes it is impossible for the applicant countries to develop a full seven‐year integrated rural development programme in a democratic manner within such a short space of time. The European Parliament raised the possibility of setting up a small group of experts on the acquis communautaire and the economic development problems facing the former Communist bloc countries, who would act in an advisory capacity in selecting measures and projects. At the same time work could continue on drawing up a rural development plan which would consequently be more realistic and of better quality.', 'In the meantime, it was decided following the Berlin summit to set up a separate budget category for accession, Category 7, which will also cover the SAPARD support and under which stricter financial rules will apply for prefinancing and financial management and responsibility than would have been the case if Category 1, in other words agriculture, measures continued to apply as the Commission had proposed, or with Category 2, which would have applied if these countries had actually become members.', 'It seems that a country in the pre‐accession phase must already meet very stringent administrative demands in order to benefit from the SAPARD pre‐accession support for agriculture. My conclusion is that all the EU bodies have the same desire to achieve successful accessions as soon as possible. But in my opinion the European Parliament has better grasped what the EU conditions mean in practice for political life in these countries. The other institutions are more focused on accountability and cost management. Time for further discussion is running out, however. This is why the European Parliament is today formally delivering its opinion, while at the same time expressing its concern at the demanding procedure.', 'Walter (PSE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on ISPA, the pre‐accession instrument for the applicant countries, and a constant monitor of the general reform of the Structural Funds I am really glad that Parliament is bringing the negotiations on Agenda 2000 to a successful conclusion this week. That will send out an important signal, both to the people of the Union and to the Central and Eastern European countries that are seeking EU membership. Europe is able to act!', 'The fact that we can now take the definitive vote on Agenda 2000 is not just a matter of course. So I want to take this opportunity to specifically congratulate the presidencies of the Council and particularly the German Presidency of the Council on managing to establish a workable run‐up to the final spurt.', 'In relation to the structural pre‐accession instrument ISPA, the Commission, the Council and Parliament broadly followed the same track. Through constructive negotiations we have, in my view, achieved a successful overall result that sends out a clear signal of our solidarity with the applicant countries.', 'The funding is limited, especially when you look at the immense need for adjustment in the applicant countries. That makes it all the more right to concentrate ISPA on supporting projects in the environmental and transport sectors, which are central to economic development, and to interlink this aid closely with other forms of pre‐accession aid, in the framework also of PHARE.', 'But like the Structural Funds as a whole, and Parliament sees this as a key point, ISPA must make a lasting contribution to job creation. We also believe it is important that the recipient countries use this instrument as a means of becoming familiar with and learning to apply the rules and mechanisms of structural policy, which will make integration all the easier later on. So it is of the utmost importance for local and regional players to be involved wherever possible.', 'Let me also take this opportunity to say something about the EU\"s future structural policy as a whole. We have no cause to jump for joy about the Structural Funds reform. However, we have found a workable compromise here that ensures that in future too we do more than just pay lip‐service to European solidarity. On the contrary! With the new Objectives 1, 2 and 3 and the Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, EQUAL and URBAN we now have powerful instruments at hand which allow us to make a major contribution to making the regions more competitive and creating jobs.', 'In concentrating on the most important aspects, it is of course inevitable that some regions will lose Objective 1 and 2 status in the medium term. So it is all the more important – and that too is a success achieved by Parliament – that we introduce generous transitional rules to ensure that the regions do not face an unreasonable and painful loss of support but have six years to adjust to the changes.', 'I am also pleased and rather proud that the European Parliament managed through tough negotiations with the Commission and the Council to carry through a fourth Community initiative. It may be called URBAN but it is something more than the previous URBAN initiative, for in future it will also benefit smaller cities and urban neighbourhoods and will take a broader approach to social and economic regeneration.', 'That also largely covers what Parliament aimed to achieve with the fifth Community initiative which we demanded last year in plenary, which means that these possibilities can also be used. With this initiative we now have an important additional job‐creating instrument.', 'Solidarity within the European Union and with the pre‐accession states, the concentrated use of resources, job creation, less bureaucracy and preparations for enlargement eastward have been the aims of the Structural Funds reform from the outset. We are now taking a decisive step forward. I thank all who have helped ensure this, whether in the Council or in the Commission – and quite particularly in the Commission – and who have given us such solid support over the past weeks, months and years. I thank them warmly. Europe may not be taking giant steps forward, but every step forward is a good step, and I think we are moving forward here.', 'Tomlinson (PSE), rapporteur. ‐ Mr President, the report that I introduce is a technical but important part of the Agenda 2000 proposals. It is amending the regulation establishing the guarantee fund for external actions. Members will recall that this was in fact presented to the House and in November 1998 referred back to committee. As a result of it being referred back to committee we now have a situation in which we are today inviting the House to approve the Commission proposal in the form on which political agreement has already been reached in the Council. That political agreement was reached at the Vienna Summit and was annexed to the Vienna Summit decisions.', 'Essentially, the amendments which have been put by Parliament, through its Committee on Budgets, to the original Commission proposal have been accepted. Our Amendment No 2 sought to oblige the Commission to review the parameters of the guarantee fund in its annual reports and now, following the political decision, the Commission must review the parameters of the guarantee fund at the time of each accession. Each one of our amendments of that type of technical nature has therefore been agreed and incorporated in the Vienna Council decision.', \"The Council also decided to depart from the Commission's original proposal by increasing the target amount to 9\\u2009% instead of 8\\u2009%, as the Commission had proposed, for the ratio of the fund to the Community's total outstanding liabilities. The provisioning rate of the fund was thereby reduced to 9\\u2009% for each loan operation, down from the previous 14\\u2009%, but still higher than the rate of 6\\u2009% that the Commission itself had proposed. In total, we have a situation which I feel satisfies all the requirements of Parliament and on that basis I commend it to the House.\", 'However, in the wider context, it is important to say today that despite all the misgivings there are about some of the details of the interinstitutional arrangement and the financial perspective, it is better to have something which is slightly inadequate in the view of some but is nevertheless agreed, than to go forward seeking perfection and actually get nothing. However there is a salutary lesson in this process for Parliament.', 'Parliament today has managed to gather less than 5\\u2009% of its Members. We have become a Parliament in which we merely deliver speeches to each other and there are precious few people here to listen. I really think this is a salutary lesson at the end of this Parliament, and the next Parliament has to take it seriously if it expects public opinion to take its debate seriously. This Parliament has got to start taking its debates seriously itself.', 'Görlach (PSE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, the new regulation on the policy to support rural development is without question a major step forward in the reform of the common agricultural policy. That is not just because nine separate regulations have been turned into one clear regulation, which is good for transparency and certainly also has an impact on the management of resources, but because it represents the move to a new policy. Of course the picture painted by the Commission, of two strong pillars side by side, is a little over‐optimistic. One of the pillars is not as strong as the other yet, as you know, Commissioner Fischler; but there is still time. We must continue to seek, in future too, to make agricultural policy for rural areas a little more flexible, for the Member States and also for the regions.', 'Let me remind you of what Commissioner Fischler once said: this policy is so important because we always have to put the question: what will the brother and sister of a young farmer who takes over a farm do on the labour market? This is where it becomes quite clear what we will have to do for the rural areas in future. That is why we are still rather attached to our earlier demand that in future of course Parliament must have codecision power over the entire spectrum of the common agricultural policy. That is still lacking. As I said on another occasion this morning: it is a necessary part of perfecting parliamentary democracy in Europe.', 'So you will understand why we agricultural politicians are strongly in favour of supporting the interinstitutional agreement. For if it becomes possible to include the accompanying measures, the expenditure on rural areas, under non‐compulsory expenditure – which obviously does not mean we do not feel obliged to spend it, but which would give Parliament more say over this increasingly important policy – you will understand our view. For the rest, it would have the advantage of allowing for transfers in the case of multiannual expenditure. We will have teething problems with this new policy in its early years. It would be a pity to lose money because of those teething troubles by not being able to transfer it.', 'Overall this is a good start. We have not grown a real tree yet, but this little sapling that we have planted together can – if the Commission and the Council nurture it just as carefully – grow into a strong and healthy tree to support rural development policy.', '(Applaus)', 'Mulder (ELDR), rapporteur. – (NL) Mr President, as rapporteur for agricultural policy funding under Agenda 2000, I should like to begin by expressing my appreciation to the German Presidency for the opportunities granted by the German Government for a trialogue on agricultural policy.', 'There are obviously a number of differences between the original proposal of Parliament\"s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was adopted in January, and the outcome of the Berlin summit. This was bound to be the case. I do not believe anyone can ever be 100\\u2009% right in these complex negotiations.', 'What we welcome is the fact that for the first time rural policy is a clear component of European agricultural policy, as Mr Görlach also said. We also believe it important – and this is also in line with my report – that the Berlin conclusions clearly state that Europe must pay more attention to European food quality, safety, environmental protection, animal welfare, and the rest. This must be developed further, and it must also be given emphasis at the WTO negotiations.', 'As many people have already said, it is also to be welcomed that rural expenditure and accompanying measures are non‐compulsory expenditure. As guarantee expenditure is fixed, I should like to ask Mr Fischler whether this means that money will be refunded to the Member States if there is a surplus for a particular year? There was some discussion in my committee about whether or not a reserve fund should be set up. There was no mention of this in Berlin, and I therefore assume that it cannot go through. Could he confirm whether my assumption is correct that the EUR 200 million and 0.03\\u2009% flexibility it includes applies to all categories including Category 1, in other words guarantee expenditure for agriculture?', 'The second question concerns accompanying measures and rural development, where different rules apply. If the money is not all used in one year my assumption is that it can be carried over to the next year. Would it be possible for the Commission to give a clear statement on how these funds can be used?', 'Little has been said about monitoring agricultural expenditure. In its January report Parliament paid particular attention to monitoring, combating fraud and that type of thing. Although this is not mentioned in the conclusions of the Berlin summit, I can assure you that Parliament will keep a very close eye on such matters.', 'One last question Commissioner Fischler: in our parliamentary resolution we also asked for the hectare subsidies, all income subsidies, to be paid before 31 October of each year. Is this possible?', 'Graefe zu Baringdorf (V), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the horizontal measures I cannot give you a positive assessment. We had a Commission proposal seeking to establish social and environmental criteria for a sliding scale of premium payments. Little remains of those criteria. Parliament had made proposals that were more distinct; the Commission checked the figures and decided they could ensure that the premiums were distributed sensibly. Now none of that is left and I will tell you some of the results.', 'Firstly, Mr Fischler, we have not reduced the over‐compensation from 1992. As in the past, 4\\u2009% of holdings will receive 40\\u2009% of the premiums, or 20\\u2009% of holdings 80\\u2009% of the premiums.', 'Second point: we have not fully offset the Agenda 2000 price reductions through the premium payments. For rationalised holdings, that means full price compensation. But smaller farms will suffer from this lower compensation.', 'Third point: we are concerned here not with money in the sense of fairness or unfairness or envy but with the fact that the price pressure exerted by holdings that continue to draw on high premium payments through over‐compensation will hit the smaller farms and put their survival at risk. That takes me to the fourth point. The money that will now flow from Brussels and from the national treasuries into the large‐scale rationalised holdings will be used by them for further rationalisation and growth. In these farms, that means job cuts, but it also means jobs losses because of the further destruction of farms in the EU.', 'Five: we have sent out wrong signals in this respect, namely that we will continue to concentrate on intervention, in the Central and Eastern European states too, instead of educating them for the market, possibly also for the world market, Mr Fischler! Anyone who wants to produce for the world market is free to do so, but should not then receive public funding. Here again we did not take the bold step we should have taken.', 'Six: we have maintained the support for maize but not managed to obtain support for pasture land. So premiums are being paid for basic fodder production, which is already favoured by natural conditions, and the maintenance of pasture land that is so urgently needed for the ecological survival of entire regions is not eligible for any support or any premium.', 'Seven: in reallocating the funds which, in your view too, we are to do from the EAGGF Guarantee section into the second pillar, only a small amount of the funds that would have been available if we had applied the degressive scale have gone to this second pillar. The 14 billion that were earmarked for the second pillar in Berlin are not in the funding proposal either.', 'On the whole, this is a negative assessment, as it must also be for the Commission, for otherwise you would retrospectively have to revise all the documents you have written to justify Agenda 2000. Basically all I have done is quote from them.', 'Garot (PSE), rapporteur. – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the COM in beef and veal was one of the delicate aspects of the new CAP for the 2000‐2006 period due to the structural imbalances of this market, the effects of the mad cow phenomenon on consumers and the role of livestock farming in land use.', 'As rapporteur for this issue, I must point out that in its initial proposal, the Commission had favoured a reform based on a substantial reduction in prices with the aim of increasing our share of the export market in the context of the restrictions imposed by the WTO.', 'In January, Parliament supported the proposal in my report: it rejected the Commission\"s recommendation and voted in favour of limiting the reduction in prices to 15\\u2009% rather than the 30\\u2009% advocated by the Commission. The Council of Ministers finally opted for a reduction of 20\\u2009% in three stages.', 'The Commission had also recommended granting livestock farmers partial financial compensation for this new reduction in prices. Contrary to my recommendations, Parliament did not vote in favour of a substantial increase in the premiums for herds of suckler cows, which actually have a positive effect on our land. But the Council has done so and it is duly noted.', 'Finally, as regards the management of the market, Parliament voted to maintain public intervention and increase controls over production. This was contrary to the Commission\"s wishes, since it proposed to balance the markets through the reduction in production prices and the introduction of private storage in 2002.', 'The Council agreed with the Commission\"s reasoning but it retained the concept of ad hoc public intervention where necessary and the plan to introduce a ‘security net\" of EUR 1 560 per tonne. It is on this point that I am proposing that Parliament vote in favour of an additional amendment to my report which has the support of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.', 'In fact, the Council\"s position on market intervention needs to be clarified because, on the one hand, it accepts the option of private storage, yet on the other, it is in favour of maintaining ad hoc public intervention. What exactly does this mean? I do not actually believe in the virtues of private storage for managing production with a structural surplus. For proof of this, we need look no further than the results this system has produced in the pigmeat sector. Furthermore, since I believe that it is equally vital to reach a compromise with the Council and the Commission, I simply proposed a compromise amendment to Parliament\"s Committee on Agriculture – which it accepted – that involved strengthening the ‘security net\" by increasing it from EUR 1 560 per tonne to EUR 2 000 per tonne.', 'In this way, we could continue along the same lines as our vote in Parliament in January and, at the same time, ensure greater security for our livestock farmers, that is, if the Council and the Commission have the good sense to support us.', 'Goepel (PPE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioners, the effects of the basic agreement on the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform on agriculture in the European Union and on farm incomes are less negative than the original Commission proposals since the price reductions are lower for cereals, beef and veal. You know that. With the introduction of rural development measures and the strengthening of the accompanying measures that have existed since the 1992 reform, we have taken a further step towards a global agricultural policy for rural areas.', 'In my view the following aspects of this agricultural reform give rise to considerable doubts. The European agricultural model sketched out at the Cork conference has only been implemented in fragmentary form. While the measures relating to market organisations, price reductions and so forth are to be applied on a strictly central basis, the implementation of most rural development measures will be left to the discretion of the Member States. Or if you like, it will be a purely political decision. Why? The rural development measures are financed as non‐compulsory expenditure under Category 1. The ceiling of EUR 4.3 billion a year can be regarded on the one hand as safeguarding rural development appropriations but on the other hand there is the risk that because the Member States would have to cofinance these measures they will not apply them or will do so only to a limited extent. Here I am thinking, for instance, of measure 2078, concerning environmentally compatible farming.', 'The direct compensation payments intended to offset the price reductions are not sufficient to make up for income losses. The additional expenditure for rural development measures is discretionary in terms of amount and use and is no substitute for the loss of purchasing power resulting from the price reductions.', 'The Commission was requested to submit an interim report on most of the market organisation regulations in the year 2002. We will see how things turn out. We greet the postponement of the reduction in milk prices to the year 2005, primarily for reasons of economy, with a certain joy. But it will not be nearly enough and we will still have a quota up to the year 2008. That is something that we can in fact live with quite easily and which at least enables us to offer our farmers some security, production security, in this area. I believe that in addition to optional set‐aside, that is the key result we in Parliament have managed to achieve.', 'Colino Salamanca (PSE), deputising for the rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Fantuzzi. I would like to express my support for his report, and particularly the proposal that aid to the sunflower sector be staggered in line with the amendment approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.', 'We have today come to the end of our debate on the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform, a reform which, in my view, has partially lost its common European focus and been distorted by the plans of various Member States. I would even go so far as to say that, in handling these proposed reforms, the European Commission – which is the driving force for action in the European Union – has given the impression that it was not very sure where it was heading.', 'Faced with some initial radical proposals aimed at encouraging European agriculture to give greater consideration to market indications and international references, it was finally agreed that the terms involved should be clarified and even that some of the sectors to be reformed should be excluded, such as the milk products sector. Its reform is being postponed until 2005 and there is no doubt that in the meantime the imbalances it suffers will become more marked.', 'Faced with the initial proposals to strengthen the link between agriculture and the environment in order to put an end to certain problems that have emerged, such as soil and water deterioration, attacks on biodiversity and so on, the Commission is proposing in the horizontal regulation that it should be the Member States who define the compulsory and general environmental standards and determine the penalties to be applied, thereby avoiding any Community focus.', 'Faced with the criteria for shaping an agricultural policy that focuses more on the structural nature of certain problems through a rural development policy that is capable of resolving some of the problems facing the countryside – the need for diversification, the need to provide the people with new opportunities and the need to prevent the constant depopulation – a minimal rural development policy has instead been chosen that lacks any real weight.', 'Faced with a situation where the agricultural policy must also respond to the principles of economic and social cohesion and correct certain excesses, such as the concentration of aid in the hands of a few, the Commission\"s response is to say that the Member States will be responsible for reducing imports, thereby rejecting an essential Community focus and the inclusion of general principles.', 'Commissioner, you recently stated in Madrid that we might have to start talking about a new reform in 2003. I think that this message is dangerous for two reasons. Firstly, coming from the lips of the very author of the reform, it highlights the fact that the current measures will not be effective enough, and this is even before we apply them. Secondly, it is impossible for European farmers and stockbreeders to continue to work and plan their future without even a basic stable framework. We cannot add uncertainties resulting from political decisions to the uncertainties that already exist because of the climate.', 'In short, the agreement may satisfy one or more of the Member States, but I do not believe that it rises to the challenges set out in Agenda 2000, including even that of enlargement.', 'And to those of my fellow countrymen who are enthusiastic about what has been decided, I would simply suggest that they should do their sums not only in absolute but also in relative terms.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR COT\\nVice‐President', 'Martin, Philippe (UPE), rapporteur. – (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the common organisation of the market in wine is undoubtedly the most complex of all the COMs. Apart from the aspects involved in regulating the vineyards and the conditions for producing grapes, we also need to take account of all the rules on oenological practices, that is, the processing of wine, as well as the rules on labelling.', 'Wine‐growing in Europe is indeed very specific. Every region has its own characteristics. Every vineyard is different in terms of its product and its quality. This clearly demonstrates that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product and that it must be treated as such. The land is also different and this diversity must be respected.', 'My report focused on this aspect. That is what those involved in the industry wanted and it is what we voted for. I am pleased that, after several meetings and discussions, our proposals now reflect the Council\"s position on many different aspects. At a structural level, the principle of the right of expansion has been accepted. Vineyards with a developing market will be able to obtain additional planting rights and the duration of these planting rights has been extended so as to allow for the rest period needed by the land between plantings. Moreover, structural measures have been introduced to support the renewal of vineyards, and we have managed to obtain support for this aspect. Few changes have been made in relation to the producer organisations, apart from an agreement allowing us to do away with the measures on the extension of their powers and to preserve, for their members alone, the tasks they are entrusted with. In terms of the recognition of interbranch organisations, these organisations have been granted a specific legal status in Community law in order to prevent them from being challenged by non‐producing Member States. As regards oenological practices, the preservation of traditional methods has been recognised, while as regards labelling, a direct labelling system has been adopted. Finally, Parliament was satisfied with the measures approved by the Council in relation to musts imported from third countries.', 'As you can see, the Council\"s compromise very closely reflects Parliament\"s proposals and we welcome that. However, it is not completely perfect. Some new decisions by the Council are of great concern and, in my view, are inadmissible, particularly the desire to include in the wine‐growing zone new Member States that are not traditionally wine‐producing nations, that is, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden. If this decision were implemented, it would undermine the content of our compromise and the spirit in which we reached agreement, that is, in the belief that our European wines were recognised as agricultural rather than industrial products, grown in traditional regions and produced using traditional methods. This decision would go against that spirit since we might eventually see in these new wine‐producing countries a shift towards using grape musts from third countries.', 'Therefore, in order to stave off this threat, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of an amendment that excludes the possibility of extending the wine‐growing zone to include any Member State other than those set out in the amendment. Finally, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believe that it is vital to establish an action and information programme to make consumers aware, in particular, of the positive effects of vine products on their health. As a result, we are tabling an amendment to this end, which I will refer to as ‘vine products and health\". Do not forget, Commissioner, that wine‐growing plays an important role in Europe, it costs very little and it has a high return.', 'Colom i Naval (PSE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, the aim of my report is to provide the European Union with the financial and budgetary framework it needs to enable it to meet the challenges of the next few years. This is the question we considered and I will admit that there is no easy answer to it; note the use of present tense here.', 'We have been thinking about and working on this for a long time: the Committee on Budgets spent many hours debating, 22 working documents were discussed and a resolution was drawn up, which was approved by the House a few months ago. I would like to take this opportunity to mention the excellent work of the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, which was always available to help me, and to thank my colleagues for their contributions and their patience.', 'I was involved in establishing the method for the financial perspective at the time of the 1987‐1988 budgetary crisis, which led to the so‐called ‘Delors I package\". I was also Parliament\"s rapporteur for the 1993 Agreement. As a result, I am very aware of the difference between dealing with a budget with a financial perspective and without a financial perspective.', 'The Interinstitutional Agreements and their financial perspectives have represented an important step forward for the Community. They have enabled us to develop the European budget in a calm and organised fashion and to fulfill a broad range of political objectives. For example, we have been able to control the unchecked increase in agricultural expenditure, consolidate and develop the cohesion policy, which is essential for economic convergence and political solidarity, integrate events such as the reunification of Germany into the Community budget, and make progress in reducing the Council\"s powers in the area of compulsory expenditure.', 'Therefore, faced with the challenges of the launch of the euro, enlargement to include the CEECs, and the essential reforms of the CAP and the structural policies, I recommended at the time that we should try to conclude a new interinstitutional agreement, even if it was against a backdrop of even greater austerity, if possible.', 'In any event, I would remind you that between 1988 and 1999, we approved and implemented Community budgets totalling just under EUR 110 000 million below the own resources ceiling.', 'Given the restrictive financial perspective proposed by the now caretaker Commission, Parliament\"s offer was clear and logical: flexibility and political progress. This was summed up in the resolution we approved in Brussels on 4 December 1997. To achieve this, we stepped up our contacts with the Commission and the Council, organised more tripartite talks and even held an informal seminar in Vienna with the presidency and the Commission to look at the issue of flexibility.', 'We also decided in December that we wanted to withdraw the so‐called ‘strategic amendments\" to the 1999 budget, and just before the Berlin European Council, our chairman, Mr Samland, sent a letter to the 15 Finance Ministers informing them of the figures the European Parliament considered to be the absolute minimum requirements, the so‐called ‘minima minimorum \".', 'The results can be presented in many ways, Mr President‐in‐Office. In its resolution of 14 April, the European Parliament did not share the idyllic version set out by the Council this morning. Any expectations we had of cuts were surpassed in Berlin. Agricultural spending was frozen, the structural policy was cut by 20\\u2009%, and internal policies were cut by 54\\u2009%, if we exclude the framework programme for research. We were then given a mandate to negotiate. We did not touch the figures for Categories 1 and 2 as we took over those from the committees responsible for the relevant legislation.', 'Although it was stated that the agreements reached in Berlin could not be changed, we have managed to obtain a further EUR 1 480 million for Category 3, which would remain – so to speak – at the 1999 level in terms of constant prices, and a further EUR 1.1 billion for administrative expenditure. The allocations for the flexibility instrument agreed on in Berlin have increased sevenfold.', 'As far as political progress is concerned, I would like to mention some of the more important and innovative advances. A series of preexisting detailed agreements were consolidated. A permanent solution is being proposed for the dispute over the classification of compulsory and non‐compulsory expenditure, which goes back to 1982. Moreover, part of the CAP expenditure is being transferred to non‐compulsory expenditure. Perhaps the final say still rests with the Council, which approves the regulations, but this is an extremely symbolic step and it opens a door to the future.', 'This is a brief summary of the basic points that convinced the Committee on Budgets to change its mind on Monday night about rejecting the Interinstitutional Agreement and to call on the House to accept it along with the corresponding financial perspective. And this is also the position of the Socialist Group, which I am now representing, as I have changed hats.', 'You will have noticed that my three minutes\" speaking time as rapporteur has run out. Up until now, I have fulfilled my institutional role. Now, if you will allow me, I should like to briefly set out my own personal view. I would like to thank my group, and particularly my colleague Mr Samland, who has allowed me to use his speaking time in the knowledge that I am going to speak against the majority position.', 'In my opinion, each of our governments went to Berlin to see what was in it for them, and very few, if any, looked to see what was in it for Europe. As far as I am concerned, that was a step backwards for European integration. I would like to know what Mr Prodi honestly thinks of all this. Does he believe that he will be able to do what he announced yesterday in this very House with these appropriations? The Council told us this morning, for example, about a possible method for combating unemployment, yet it is cutting the budgetary framework for such measures. I want an agreement, but not just any agreement. And as far as I can see, this agreement would be of less use to us than the strict application of Article 272 of the Treaty. Moreover, when push comes to shove any flexibility we achieve is made rigid and open to criticism by the Council.', 'Between the 1.27\\u2009% – which we criticised in December 1997 – and the 0.97\\u2009% agreed in Berlin, there was enough room for manoeuvre to reach an agreement which would have been rigorous yet better for Europe. I am prepared to accept a figure of 1.13\\u2009% if we add enlargement, although who knows when enlargement will take place.', 'I would like to remind you that the two previous Interinstitutional Agreements entered into force five and seven months respectively after the budget period being planned. There are no funds in this package for essential policies. We are freezing Category 3. In Category 4, there is only a statement in case the crisis in Kosovo calls for a review of the financial perspective. And we are told that the Council would be prepared to accept such a review before the entry into force of the financial perspective it wants us to adopt today.', 'When Spain and Portugal joined the Community, Parliament raised the ceilings for budgetary increases that were established in the MRI. But now the applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are being offered a pittance and told that, if they join, they will be treated with kid gloves.', 'We talk about powers yet, in my view, we are only looking at things in terms of their face value. With this Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council would de facto approve the budget for seven years. Parliament has no political leeway. Therefore, since I am in favour of more Europe, although with the same budget – and I do not believe we can achieve it with any less – I cannot in all conscience recommend that the House approve this agreement.', \"Kellett‐Bowman (PPE), rapporteur. ‐ Mr President, I should like first to speak on the Committee on Budgets' opinion for the second reading of Mr Arias Cañete's report: arrangements and conditions for structural assistance in the fisheries sector. His report already includes budget amendments on technical assistance. However, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I must ask the House not to support Amendments 5, 53 and 54, which do not follow the principles of the regulation.\", \"Turning to my second reading recommendation for Community financial aid in the field of trans‐European networks, this work is being carried out under the old Treaty and now recognises the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. There have been many meetings and the Commission and Council have moved a long way to converge around the European Parliament's position. I would like to thank the Commission and the hard‐working German presidency of the Council for their cooperation in this codecision‐type procedure.\", 'The Committee on Budgets have supported the proposal to involve private capital in financing network projects and has raised the possibility of increasing this from 1\\u2009% to 2\\u2009%. We have supported Galileo, the proposed European global positioning technology, and we have supported the Committee on Transport in its wish to have 55\\u2009% of the funding ring‐fenced for railways and a maximum of 25\\u2009% for roads.', 'I believe this report strengthens Community involvement in the construction of networks. The funding is a contribution to the projects. It will act as an economic multiplier and provide many jobs. Peripheral regions will benefit and business will have reduced costs in the global markets. However, the total amount has been in doubt. The figure in the first reading, which the House voted yesterday, was EUR 5.5 billion. Following Dresden, Berlin and intensive negotiations I am recommending that the figure be EUR 4.6 billion. Unfortunately, the Council is unable to rise as far as this. Its sticking‐point was EUR 4.5 billion, and it was starting from a very low base of 3.2. It was up to the Council to agree our figure or start the whole process of codecision once again.', 'I am delighted to report to the House that the Council agreed to 4.6 billion at its meeting this morning.', 'Mr President, I commend this report and its 21 amendments to the House.', 'Wulf‐Mathies, Commission. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission submitted its proposals on the reform of the Structural Funds in March 1998, there was some doubt as to whether a genuine reform could be achieved and whether the regulations could be adopted early enough to enable the new programmes to begin according to plan early in 2000. Today I most particularly thank the rapporteurs Mrs McCarthy, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Collins, Mr Walter, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Arias Cañete, in his capacity also as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy. I believe that together with Council we have managed actually to achieve what many people considered unlikely.', 'Earlier on I set out the basic principles of the Structural Funds reform, so I will not bore you now with my specific position on each amendment, because according to my understanding of all your contributions to the discussion, you want to follow the procedure we agreed. Certainly you would have liked to see better results in one or other respect, as we would too, but it is our joint understanding that we have now gone as far as we could and really do want to transpose this into concrete legislative acts.', 'So I just want to go into a few very specific questions. On the subject of islands: I have noted during many of our discussions in this Chamber how many islanders belong to this Parliament, and I am indeed all in favour of that. But I think that islanders also agree with the broad majority of Parliament and the Commission that the principle of economic and social cohesion primarily applies to the poorest and structurally weakest regions, which is indeed why we want to allocate 70\\u2009% of all funding to these regions, regardless of whether their inhabitants live on the mainland or on an island.', 'If we are honest with each other we know that there is no point in making insularity as such a criterion for support, for as it says in the Treaty, structural aid is granted to compensate for the disadvantages of certain regions and social groups, and in their interests we should adhere to that principle. For if we do not, we will end up harming precisely those whom we all want to help most. Incidentally, the same applies to a number of other requests for Structural Funds aid. These funds are not a pot of money that people can freely dip into if they need more money for something; they are the means to a quite specific end, namely to promote the economic and social cohesion of this Union and to give practical application to the principle that solidarity is one of the vital foundations of the continued existence of the European Union.', 'And that is why we do not have a cultural fund as such either but finance cultural measures in exactly the same way as tourism measures if, firstly, they serve to create jobs and, secondly, they promote regional development; but we are not an institute of culture pure and simple. As for the transitional rules discussed here, or the fact that some assistance has to be phased out, we are not trying to be mean but are taking account of the fact that some regions have made progress and that we always care for the poorest first and cannot give further support to the rich, who will then slowly move closer to the average.', 'Mrs Schroedter brought up the famous list of favours again. I think it is important to note that in all this accounts for no more than 2\\u2009% of total funding and that one could say it has no influence at all on the structural decisions of the Funds. I also want to point out quite clearly that such important initiatives as the PEACE initiative also come under it.', 'To prevent any misunderstanding, let me say to Mr Arias Cañete in regard to the fisheries measures that there are some amendments that the Commission does not accept because they relate to measures that require a Council decision which we cannot simply anticipate at this point. Moreover, we want to see the measures relating to the fishing fleet reformed and do not agree with your proposals in this regard.', 'Otherwise I think it is clear that on the whole Parliament has been most successful. I thank you all for your very close and trusting cooperation. I forgot to thank the rapporteurs Mr Varela and Mrs Jöns so let me do so now. I am glad that with the new code of conduct, which adjusts past procedures to the new legal situation, this close cooperation will continue in future too and I hope that it will also be carried over to the new Parliament.', \"Flynn, Commission. ‐ I would like to say a few words about the Social Fund. Here in particular Parliament has codecision, and your concerns are clearly evident in the new text. In fact Parliament's support for and contribution to the reform has been crucial. I would like particularly to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for her excellent work here.\", \"We can be proud of the results in four particular areas: the universal agreement on the overarching priority of employment and the Social Fund's mission to underpin the European employment strategy; secondly, the confirmation of the thematic structure of the funds regulation and the scope of the five policy fields, extending from active labour market policies, through social inclusion, lifelong learning and adaptability, to positive action for women; thirdly, we have maintained and strengthened the commitment to support non‐governmental organisations and the combating of social exclusion – we share the view that the regulation must oblige Member States to provide for small grants with special access arrangements for non‐governmental organisations and local partnerships: fourthly, again with the support of Parliament, we have strengthened the equal opportunities provisions and the mainstreaming principle of the regulation.\", \"Today's plenary session provides the opportunity for Parliament to influence the final shape of the regulation, now as co‐legislator. The Commission would be very happy to recommend the compromise amendments put forward by the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, covering: the addition of social integration into the labour market to Article 1, namely Amendment No 1; the new wording on the social economy third system in Article 2, namely Amendment No 8; the importance which both the Commission and Parliament feel needs to be attached to the principles of equal opportunity and adaptability, namely Amendment No 9; and the better arrangements that you are proposing for the operation of small grants with special access arrangements for non‐governmental organisations, namely Amendment No 10.\", 'As regards the mainstreaming amendment I agree that the principle is essential but it is already covered both in the general regulation and in Article 2 of the regulation itself. So given the problems which it might cause in the Council I would incline, as the rapporteur does, to agree, and to argue against acceptance. Once the structural funds regulations for the new period are in place the Social Fund will enjoy a new lease of life in view of the increased emphasis given to the employment dimension in all Community policies and in the Structural Funds in particular.', \"We would all be proud of the ongoing success of the European employment strategy, which is the European Union's chief response to the need for more and better jobs. We have intentionally defined the scope of the fund to allow it to respond to developments in the economy and the labour market over the next seven years, always with a view to encouraging and enabling more people to participate actively in the labour market. To do this we must focus more strongly than ever on activation instruments which help people to become more employable, rather than passive policies. At the same time we should make every effort to strengthen the element of prevention to stop people becoming unemployed in the first place, a point very effectively made by the rapporteur. It is only through this flexible, forward‐looking and, above all, inclusive approach that Europe will be able to meet the economic and social challenges of the new millennium.\", \"The Social Fund is the one Structural Fund directed exclusively at the individual person. It is about enabling individuals to progress into the new millennium; about letting people themselves make that progress through training and education, by increasing their chances of getting a job, about helping them to move forward over time to a better job and to a better standard of living. This is why the Social Fund, acting alongside the employment strategy, is so important for the future of Europe. Employment still largely defines a person's standard of life and weighs heavily on their expectations of what they can contribute to society and what society can offer to them. Increasing people's chances of keeping their jobs, getting a job or a better job is what we can do with the support of the European Social Fund. I believe that as a result of the work that has taken place between the institutions and taking on the amendments that I mentioned earlier, we have made the text as good as it can be got at this time. I commend it to you and ask you to support it and to support the rapporteur in her proposals too.\", 'Fischler, Commission. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has of course been a great deal of discussion about the Berlin decisions in the agriculture sector over the last few weeks. Very different views have also been expressed in today\"s debate. Let me make my position clear. The reform certainly does not go quite as far as we had hoped, which gives rise to a degree of uncertainty as also of risk. But at the same time we should not underestimate what we have achieved. The Berlin agreement, following the Agriculture Council\"s compromise, provides for a reduction of only 15\\u2009% in cereal prices and the approximation of oilseed aid to the reduced cereal aid, and provides that the reform of the milk sector will not begin until the year 2000. Nevertheless this remains without doubt the most far‐reaching reform the Union has ever undertaken in the agriculture sector.', 'This is all the more true in that even in the run‐up to it the tobacco and olive oil sector were also reformed. But above all there is one thing we should not forget, namely that the Heads of State and Government decided these reforms unanimously and that the direction agricultural policy was to follow in the coming years was therefore determined unanimously. That gives us a distinctly stronger position in the coming international discussions and negotiations.', 'Let me briefly outline the main reasons for the reform and the central elements of the overall agreement reached. In the cereal sector and the beef and veal sector in particular, the analyses carried out by the Commission showed that there is a serious risk of production surpluses increasing again soon after the year 2000. In view of that situation, in principle we were faced with the choice of two courses: either we could choose the increasingly rigid control of supply and make that the core of the common agricultural policy, or we could adjust our policy in such a way as to enable us to sell to new, additional markets.', 'It was decided in Berlin that in the longer term we want to choose the second course, which means we have to make European agriculture more competitive. We must also take greater account of justified consumer concerns. This stronger market orientation will be counterbalanced by higher direct payments and additional opportunities to open up new income sources within and outside farming. In Berlin we also made significant progress towards sustainable agriculture by managing to incorporate environmental concerns more firmly than before in market policy and rural development policy.', 'Moreover, the Agenda decisions created a second pillar of the common agricultural policy. It is true that this second pillar is still a little less solid than the first. But we have laid the foundation stone for it and in principle that pillar now exists. In future we shall probably have to consider how to consolidate it.', 'In the budget, we will in future have two sub‐ceilings for agricultural expenditure. This subdivision into compulsory expenditure and non‐compulsory expenditure was decided in Berlin and confirmed here in Parliament. It means we now have one upper limit for traditional guarantee expenditure and a second upper limit for rural development. That will of course make everything rather more rigid, and also to some extent less flexible. I can understand why Parliament insists on this aspect, in its capacity as budgetary authority, and I hope that budgetary discipline does not mean inflexibility. For that would tend to weaken this second pillar, the more innovative part of the policy.', 'Overall, the reform that was agreed in Berlin represents an important step forward. Yet certain risks and imponderables remain. In particular, nobody can tell today whether the lower price guarantee reductions agreed in the final compromise will be enough to really achieve market balance. In the preparations for the new WTO negotiations and the enlargement negotiations we will have to take due account of these constraints, as we will do when we implement the organisation of the market in coming years. But there are certainly also some grounds for confidence.', 'We will enter into the WTO negotiations with very clear ideas about the kind of agriculture we want in Europe: a competitive and sustainable agriculture that supplies the consumer with high‐quality products. And that is also the agricultural model that we want to offer our partners in Eastern Europe, together with the new, second CAP pillar.', 'Let me conclude with a few comments on the amendments. First, I do agree that we should strengthen rural development policy, but to strengthen the measures for the disadvantaged regions without increasing the funding would mean having to divert these funds from other rural development measures.', 'Secondly, in the Commission\"s view intervention buying at higher prices in the beef and veal sector would lead to new, unmarketable surpluses and exert considerable pressure on the budget, as also on our market prices. If the cuts in oilseed payments were extended over a four‐year period that would postpone the lifting of the Blair House restrictions by another year and also require more budget funds that are not covered.', 'Turning to Mr Mulder\"s question about transferability: I too think we should discuss this matter further. I consider it most important that, over and above the time span, we manage to develop enough flexibility in relation to that part of rural development to make it possible actually to use the available resources. As for the payment deadline of 31 October, I am prepared to give further consideration to this question, though with the reservation that this must not lead to any shift in the financial year for compulsory expenditure.', 'In reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf I would point out that the new agricultural policy certainly will bring about a shift in this 80: 20 ratio and that under the reform the smaller farmers will in fact have distinctly greater opportunities than they used to. For the rest I would also point out that the Commission never proposed aiming at full price equalisation. We never spoke of anything more than income equalisation, which does not automatically mean the same thing.', 'Finally, let me give warm thanks to all the rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation. My special thanks today go to the long‐standing chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Colino Salamanca.', '(Applaus)', 'This is the last debate on the future of the common agricultural policy in which you will be taking part in this House. I thank you on behalf of the Commission, but also very much on my own behalf, for the important work you have done for the benefit of European agriculture. I also wish you all the best for the future!', '(Applaus)', 'Goepel (PPE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler a supplementary question. Can I assume that the Commission accepts those amendments in the second report, such as those on the milk sector, which you did not mention?', 'Fischler, Commission. – (DE) Mr Goepel, I did not go into that question because it did not come up in the statement made by the rapporteur on the milk sector during the debate. But I can tell you this much: we are prepared to return to the earlier formula and review the milk market in the year 2003. Of course the Commission is also prepared to consider the question of the superlevy in the framework of that review.', 'Liikanen, Commission. ‐ The financial perspectives for 2000‐2006 and the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and improving the budgetary procedure are an integral part of the package of Agenda 2000. I understand from the reports and intervention of Mr Colom i Naval that there are different views in the European Parliament on this item.', 'Let me for that reason point out some of the principal reasons why the Commission supports the agreement. It is true that the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin with regard to the financial perspectives for 2000‐2006 remain below the Commission proposal. But the subsequent negotiations, under pressure from the European Parliament delegation, achieved substantial improvements. For internal policies the proposal in front of you exceeds the conclusions of Berlin by EUR 1.5 billion. These will permit the financing of the multiannual priority programmes, for example, trans‐European networks. And it safeguards a significant margin for new policy initiatives.', 'For external actions there is a clear commitment from the Council to finance additional needs arising from the situation in the Balkans, if necessary, by means of a revision of the financial perspectives.', 'With regard to administrative expenditure, the agreement would permit the financing of some 1000 new posts for the Community institutions and also finance the new Statute of the Members of the European Parliament, even though a solution on that issue is not yet clear as you know.', 'The new interinstitutional agreement also marks significant progress on key questions of the budget procedure. The agreement clarifies the classification of expenditure which defines the budgetary powers of Council and Parliament. This removes a perpetual source of conflict. In the process, Parliament has widened its budgetary powers in the field of agriculture expenditure. Furthermore, the agreement provides for full cooperation between both branches of the budgetary authority on all parts of the budget, which Parliament has long fought for.', 'Mr President, without the agreement these procedural gains would be lost. There would be a high risk of an annual budget confrontation. This would not be in the interests of the Union and its policies.', \"Secondly, I want to reply to Lord Tomlinson on his report. Firstly, the Commission is pleased with the agreement by the Council because that takes into account the major part of the preoccupations of the European Parliament. On the amendments proposed in Lord Tomlinson's report, the Commission is ready to accept Amendments 1 and 2. As far as Amendments 3 and 4 are concerned, the Commission has accepted a joint declaration in the regulation according to which the Commission will give all oral information to the Council and Parliament on the economic situation of the beneficiary countries which are receiving loans and on the risks which I have explained when the annual report is presented. For that reason the Commission does not find it necessary to introduce these Amendments 3 and 4 into the regulation of the Guarantee Fund.\", 'Mulder (ELDR), rapporteur. ‐ Mr President, I would like to repeat a question I asked earlier and the answer can be just ‘yes\" or ‘no\". My question was whether the flexibility of 200 million and 0.03\\u2009% applies to all the categories of the budget, including category 1.', \"Liikanen, Commission.- 'Yes.\", '(Laughter)', 'Kinnock, Neil, Commission. ‐ I should like to begin by welcoming the agreement between the Council and Parliament on the trans‐European networks financial regulation. This vital component of the Agenda 2000 package has the twin distinctions of being the first legal text arising from Agenda 2000 that achieved a common position in the Council and yet the last to be agreed by the Council and the European Parliament. It also is one of the first legal acts to be adopted under the codecision procedure set down in the Amsterdam Treaty. I hope that the amicable and productive precedent shown here will be followed on many other occasions. It may be that I am displaying an excess of optimism in my old age!', 'Much of the credit for achieving the agreement goes to the rapporteur, Mr Kellett‐Bowman, whom I am glad to see in the House. He has shown a real understanding of the financing requirements of the trans‐European networks and a determination to put in place a stable long‐term framework for the financing of major TENs projects. His colleagues like Mr Samland and others – whom I am also glad to see in the House – have helped produce a very productive and effective package.', \"Clearly the most important issue is the overall financial envelope of EUR 4.6 bn over the 2000‐2006 period. That sum is more modest than the Commission's opening bid. But I am glad to say that it represents a real increase of around 10\\u2009% and is fully consistent with the lower ceiling for internal policies that was agreed at the Berlin Summit.\", 'Apart from the useful increase in funding, the new financial regulation is a major step forward as an appropriate instrument for providing long‐term finance for long‐term projects because it includes multiannual programming, which means that project promoters will be able to plan with unprecedented certainty about the finance they can expect from the trans‐European networks budget. That is particularly important for the development and encouragement of public/private partnerships.', 'Other important elements of the revised regulation include, first, a truly new facility for the investment of TENs money in risk capital funds with the aim of gaining access to the potentially very large resources of long‐term funding available from insurance companies and pension funds for the financing of public infrastructure projects.', 'Second, the regulation provides for the possibility of financing up to 20\\u2009% of the Galileo satellite navigation project – around EUR 500 m – and doing so from the TENs budget. That component is essential in order to demonstrate that this vital project can be financed and also to ensure that it develops as a genuinely European project. I hope that any discussion of European Union finance for innovative TENs projects at the current European Council will confirm the importance of Galileo for European producers and for European users.', \"With the news today, from COREPER that the Council can accept the compromise reflected in the amendments before us today. I can also confirm full support from the Commission for Parliament's position. I therefore look forward to early adoption of the revised regulation in good time for the implementation of multiannual programming that will commence in the year 2000. I express gratitude – not just from the Commission but much more widely from the general public in the Community and from industry – for the foresight and the commitment demonstrated by Parliament on this issue.\", 'Samland (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, let me just say to the Commissioners here present that our joy at the conclusion of the trans‐European networks and of the already concluded fifth framework programme of research is still slightly clouded. I will add another drop of water so that you do not open the champagne too soon.', 'Both questions were explicitly tied to a new financial perspective. If Parliament does not agree tomorrow to give its assent to a new interinstitutional agreement, then we will not have the financial framework which we have just discussed and on the basis of which the two agreements, on the fifth framework programme of research and on the trans‐European networks, were concluded. I just wanted to say this now, as a reservation, before the champagne starts to flow.', 'Kinnock, Neil, Commission. ‐ I have been under the distinct impression for four and a half years that Mr Samland could turn water into wine. I am looking to great things!', '(Laughter)', 'President . – That would be a new kind of magic.', 'We shall now move on to the general debate.', 'Ghilardotti (PSE). – (IT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the European Social Fund.', 'We have perhaps come to the end of a long task which started with an own‐initiative report by the European Parliament on the European Social Fund. We must acknowledge the fact that the Commission has accepted the European Parliament\"s position on objectives and priorities, as well as on procedures. Here I want to stress an important point: the close link between the European Social Fund priorities and the employment guidelines. The European Social Fund is certainly the basic Community instrument for applying the four pillars, especially employability, and the regulation we are discussing today is consistent with the objectives of social integration and non‐discrimination. Considering work as both an economic opportunity and a way of achieving one\"s potential means more and better education lifelong. It means combatting material inequalities and the modern inequalities which affect an individual\"s ability to plan his own future freely. All that makes the European Social Fund a fundamental instrument, and likewise makes it fundamentally important for the NGOs and the third sector to be involved right from the planning stage, principally through a policy of practical integration. That will certainly be the responsibility of the Member States, but it will also be up to the Commission to monitor and control it.', 'I would like to conclude by taking up a point already mentioned by Mrs Jöns: the Council\"s unwillingness to become explicitly involved in gender mainstreaming, one of the four pillars of European employment strategy, is incomprehensible – and it is especially incomprehensible now the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force, enshrining equal opportunities as a fundamental principle of the Union. I hope the Council will be willing to accept the amendments from the European Parliament to complete this journey in rapid time and to the satisfaction of all the European institutions.', 'Porto (PPE). – (PT) Mr President, I too am going to talk about the European Social Fund but in relation to external economic relations. This is because I was the draftsman of the opinion on this for the Committee on External Economic Relations. Social promotion is naturally determined in the first instance by meeting the basic needs of our citizens and there is clearly much to do in this area.', 'Yet this must be achieved if we are to maintain the European social model we can be proud of. However, we must remember that this must be a realistic model where the improvement in working conditions reflects the improvement in productivity. This is where Agenda 2000 has to come in, by providing the resources which are essential for the continuation of this model together with the infrastructures cofinanced by the ERDF, the EAGGF Guidance Section or the Cohesion Fund. It must also provide training or reassign the workforce with the support of the Social Fund.', 'Given the current state of globalisation, it would be unacceptable to aim to compete with less‐developed countries by reducing wages or allowing a deterioration in working conditions in our continent. However, we also cannot accept a protectionist approach such as the strategy where we were digging our own grave and running away from our responsibilities towards the rest of the world, particularly the less‐developed areas.', 'In everyone\"s interest, we must move towards a strategy of openness in which we and others clearly respect the rules of traditional trade. In this way, Europe surely has an important role to play through competition conditions which depend largely on the training of individuals.', 'Vallvé (ELDR). – (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we have come to the end of this debate on Agenda 2000, and tomorrow the House will surely approve these regulations, with which I believe we have managed to improve one of the Union\"s fundamental objectives: economic and social cohesion and better territorial cohesion.', 'This improved economic and social cohesion should bring with it the creation of jobs and thereby attack the European Union\"s main problem: unemployment. In my view, Commissioner, an excellent and positive reform of the Structural Funds has been concluded, with projects aimed at concentration and simplification and with an effective partnership as a result of the contribution of regional and local authorities, which may lead to increased efficiency in the actual implementation of the Structural Funds.', 'We have also taken an important step with the reduction of Community initiatives, and you have been particularly keen to ensure that only the Community initiatives with a European dimension are accepted. A final decision by the Council, at the request of Parliament, has included a fourth Community initiative which will also have very specific advantages for certain sections of the European Union\"s population, although it does not have the Community dimension that the other three initiatives have.', 'We regret that the Berlin European Council agreed to significantly reduce the funding to be allocated both to the Structural Funds and to the Cohesion Fund, but we understand that these will be implemented in a positive manner over the next seven years. We also need to take account of the fact that the Structural Funds are practically the last to apply to the 15 Member States, since the prospect of enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will change the regional action policies for years to come.', 'I would finally like to thank the Commissioner for the efficient work she has done, which will ensure that the new regional policy for the 2000‐2007 period will always be linked to her because of the enormous importance of her contribution.', 'Escolá Hernando (ARE). – (ES) Mr President, after months of arduous debate and complicated negotiations, the time has come for the European Parliament to say yes or no to Agenda 2000. Personally, I am not going to say yes to Agenda 2000.', 'My impression is that the agreement that has been reached is an agreement based not on the Union\"s needs but on the negotiation of national interests. That is the only explanation for the fact that the Commission\"s initial proposal was further diminished through the final agreement reached at the Berlin European Council, despite the fact that it already involved reducing the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund below their existing levels.', 'For those of us who believe in a federal Europe based on social and economic cohesion, a golden opportunity has been lost to increase equality between the various regions of Europe. Furthermore, if we are getting involved in this idea of defending territorial interests, as the Berlin European Council did, I would still not be able to vote in favour of Agenda 2000. I was elected by the people of a specific European region – the region of Aragon – and this agreement would put the people I represent at a serious disadvantage compared with their current situation.', 'Finally, I would point out that the agreement contains serious contradictions. To give you an example, Commissioner, one single problem – that of depopulation – is dealt with in three different ways in Agenda 2000. Firstly, the underpopulated regions of Northern Europe are granted Objective 1 status, that is, they have access to the main Structural Funds. Secondly, the Scottish Highlands are only granted special funding in the form of compensation. Finally – and this is the third way in which depopulation is tackled – other regions that suffer from the same problem, such as Aragon, are excluded from this aid altogether.', 'A single problem cannot be dealt with in three different ways if we want Europe\"s structural policy to be consistent. As a result, I must say once again that I am not going to vote in favour of Agenda 2000.', 'IN THE CHAIR: MR GUTIÉRREZ DÍAZ\\nVice‐President', 'President.- Thank You, Mr Escolá.', 'Following that speech by Mr Escolá, ladies and gentlemen, we shall suspend the debate on Agenda 2000.

Question Time (Council)', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is questions to the Council (B4‐0337/99).', 'President . – As the author is not present, Question No 1 lapses.', 'Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (H−0324/99)', 'Subject: A fair trial for Öcalan', 'In their statements on the Öcalan affair, all the European Union institutions have been unanimous in calling for a fair, open trial, in line with the conception prevailing in the legal systems of modern, civilized societies. However, the Turkish Government has so far rejected, in both words and deeds (obstructing the defence counsel, refusing requests for observers to attend the trial, etc.), all attempts to bring about a fair and open trial. Can the Council therefore state what steps it intends to take to ensure that the Kurdish leader does not suffer mental or physical harm and is guaranteed the right to defence, to which any person facing judicial charges in civilised societies is entitled as a matter of course?', \"I should like to welcome the President‐in‐Office and ask him to reply to Mr Alavanos's question.\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, let me answer this question as follows. The Council expects Turkey, like any other contracting party, to fully and entirely fulfil the obligations arising from the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Furthermore, the Council is assuming that Turkey will respect the right of any person facing judicial proceedings in Turkey, which therefore includes Mr Öcalan, to a fair trial and their right to defence, both of which are indeed also enshrined in the Turkish constitution. In its statement of 22 February 1999, the European Union took note of the Turkish Government\"s assurances to that effect.', 'Alavanos (GUE/NGL). ‐ (EL) Mr President, the German Presidency has taken us somewhat by surprise, and I am ashamed at what I have just heard from the President‐in‐Office.', 'At a time when Yugoslavia is being bombed we are indulging in ‘savoir vivre \" with the Turkish Government, and the German Presidency is telling us that it has received assurances. All the Members here today have received an announcement from Amnesty International which states that Mr Öcalan\"s lawyers, Nyadji Bulgan and Irfan Didar, and others, have been tortured, and were attacked inside the court. Following that they were rounded up outside the court and beaten by the police. And the President‐in‐Office is indulging in ‘savoir vivre \" with Turkey.', 'I ask once again: are the European Union and indeed the German Presidency interested in human rights? If so, how can the German Presidency not do anything, how can it remain silent and say such things as what it said in its answer about these despicable events taking place at the trial of Mr Öcalan?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Alavanos, I reject quite categorically your attack on the presidency. You know the rules here. What I have to present is the common position that 15 Member States have formulated on your question. I cannot inform you of the German position as it is totally irrelevant. It is not a question here of the presidency\"s view but of what the Council says. That is what I have told you and I will repeat it: the Council expects and requires Turkey to comply with its national and international obligations, which arise from its own constitution and its accession to international conventions.', 'President.- Thank you, mr.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 3 to 11 will not be taken because they refer to subjects which are included on the agenda for this part‐session.', 'Mr Morris has the floor on a point of order.', 'Morris (PSE). – Mr President, my point of order is quite clear.

At the time of the incident you describe in your question, the Schengen acquis had not yet been integrated into the framework of the European Union. Since it is a question here of relations between two Schengen partners, the admissibility of internal border controls comes under the Schengen implementing convention. Article 2(2) of that agreement provides that internal border controls can be carried out for a limited period purely for the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security. The state that orders these controls decides whether this may apply here. The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty does not change this situation.', 'Pailler (GUE/NGL). – (FR) Mr President‐in‐Office, each time we put questions to you here, you take refuge in regulatory issues, which I fully understand. Clearly, after two months, the Schengen provisions were not fully applied, but I feel that the Council\"s role is a political one.', 'At a time when Europe is looking for its soul and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, is telling us that we will find it in American culture, I wonder if we might not be able to generate a little enthusiasm among the people of Europe by allowing them to do something exciting that forms part of their culture, in other words, demonstrate solidarity in fighting for human rights across borders.', 'I am therefore seeking a political response from you, Mr President‐in‐Office, given that you are a minister. And I would like to know if, in the Council of Ministers, when discussing immigrants, you talk not only about security problems – which you naturally discuss in great detail, as demonstrated on a daily basis by the Austrian and German Presidencies – but also about the fact that people, along with capital, have the right to free movement.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Pailler, I have to tell you too that it is not a question of my personal view nor of the presidency\"s view. I can only give you an answer agreed by the two states concerned, which you mention in your question. Surely you can imagine the answer you would be given by the government concerned if you put the question to it in your national parliament. I cannot go any further than that. The Council is not competent in regard to your question. The Commission is responsible for compliance with Community law. I must ask you to put this question to the Commission.', 'As for the matter of principle addressed in your question, I can tell you that the Council is looking closely at the problem of how Europe can be brought closer to our people, how they can be made more aware of the advantages Europe offers them and also how we can increase these advantages, especially in the field of internal and judicial policy which we are just discussing. Indeed we are already preparing a summit to be held in Finland in the autumn, which will be concerned with the further development of the People\"s Europe.', 'But let me say again: individual cases such as this one do not come within the Council\"s remit. And the individual states would not tolerate any interference from the Council in the way they apply national or European law.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Verheugen, but I must ask you to remain with this question as I have received requests for two supplementary questions.

Can the European Union tolerate three thousand citizens being prevented on alleged police grounds from exercising their full rights as European citizens?', 'I put that to you as a political question and I expect a political answer.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Ripa di Meana, I have to disappoint you too, however much you expect me as a politician to give a political answer. You know the rules of Question Time. I cannot give you a political answer off the cuff. I will have to discuss it first with the French and Italian Governments and with all the other 13 governments. After that you can have your political answer. All I can do here is point out to you that the French Government is basing its decision on Article 2(2) of the Schengen implementing convention. Naturally the French Republic, like any other member of Schengen, may carry out internal border controls for reasons of public law and order. Whether or not that was justified in this particular case is something I as a politician have a very definite view on. But I am not allowed to express it here.', 'Jensen, Lis (I‐EDN). – (DA) I have a question for the President‐in‐Office concerning Regulation No 1408/71. It is true that the European Union is in a difficult situation, since the Commission has been put out of action, so to speak, but clarification is needed of the proposal which has been put forward by the Commission regarding the amendment of Regulation No 1408. I would like to ask directly how the President‐in‐Office views the Danish early retirement benefit in relation to Regulation No 1408. Hitherto, the Danish early retirement benefit scheme has been kept out of the regulation, since it has been said not to be a social scheme, but an employment scheme. The fact is that the Danish Government has been given until the end of April to respond, and I would very much like to know when this question will come up in the Council.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Jensen, I am rather at a loss. This was a supplementary to Mrs Pailler\"s question. That question referred to the fact that on the evening of 26 March the French authorities refused 3 000 Italian nationals entry into France. With the best will in the world I cannot see what bearing your question has on that incident. But I am quite prepared to answer it in writing.', 'President.-', 'Question No 13 by Otto von Habsburg (H−0329/99)', 'Subject: Humanitarian aid to the needy in Ukraine', \"It is reported by reliable sources that, in accordance with the so‐called ‘law on the protection of domestic commodity production', small packets containing food products, clothing or even medicines are being designated as ‘agricultural products' and returned to senders.\", 'This impacts very harshly on the poorest people in the country, in particular those on old‐age pensions, many of whom have to live on the equivalent of 37 to 50 German marks a month.', 'Is the Council prepared to make representations to the Ukrainian government with a view to getting this policy reversed by reason of the humanitarian nature of these mailings?', \"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr von Habsburg's question.\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, it is true that there were private initiatives until July/August last year to support needy Ukrainians by sending them parcels mainly containing food, medicines and clothing.', 'Under presidential decree 738/98 of 4 July 1998 on imports of humanitarian aid from abroad, since that date only legal entities whose charitable status is established by law are recognised as recipients of duty‐free imports of humanitarian aid, but not private individuals. Since then, packages of aid addressed to private individuals have been returned to the sender by the Ukrainian customs authorities, pursuant to Law 468/97 on the state regulation of imports of agricultural products into Ukraine. That law has been in force since 15 June 1998 and the presidency knows from own experience that this in fact also involves high costs for the senders of the packages.', 'In the framework of bilateral talks, the German Government as the presidency has on numerous occasions urged, in fact insistently urged the Ukrainian Government to change these rules for humanitarian reasons, but unfortunately Ukraine has not responded at all to these efforts.', 'The presidency will raise this matter in Brussels, at the second EU‐Ukraine Cooperation Committee scheduled for July, after coordinating with its partners, especially Finland, and will make it an official subject of discussion between the EU and Ukraine.', 'von Habsburg (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Minister, I sincerely thank you for this clear, detailed and satisfactory answer to my question. It is a pleasure to see that this can sometimes happen during Question Time.', 'Let me specifically ask you to make every effort in this matter. I receive a great many letters from Ukrainian pensioners who are in a really bad way and need help. If at all possible, I would ask you, Minister, to take very energetic steps to help them. After all they are our partners and will one day become our partners in the European Union. I would be most grateful if you could repeat and emphasise this need again.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr von Habsburg. I believe that this is your last question in Parliament and I must therefore thank you once again for your excellent speeches here during Question Time, and for your admirable brevity and respect for the time you are allocated.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, I take what you have just said not so much as a question but more as words of encouragement, which I am happy to accept. I can assure you that we are keeping up constant pressure on Ukraine in relation to this matter. One reason I was able to answer the question was that I know from my own practical political experience that there are cases, especially the cases I am sure you know too, where it is possible to get round this law and what that costs those concerned. It really is hard to understand why someone who provides aid on an individual basis should incur costs that are many times higher than the value of the aid itself. Here I agree entirely with you and we will keep up the pressure on Ukraine in this respect.', 'President . – As the author is not present, Question No 14 lapses.', 'Question No 15 By Manuel Medina Ortega (H - 0339/99)', 'Subject: Development of Article 299(2)', 'In view of the imminent entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, what initiatives is the Council preparing for the development of Article 299(2) on the status of the outermost regions?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, I really must admit that you are wasting no time in putting forward the interests of these regions here in Parliament, given that the Treaty has only been in force for four or five days. But basically that already answers your question, for pursuant to Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam the Commission must first make a proposal to that effect. Only when that proposal has been made can the Council take action and discuss specific measures for the outermost regions. But to date the Commission has made no such proposal.', 'Medina Ortega (PSE). – (ES) I would like to thank the President‐in‐Office for his rapid and efficient response. In actual fact the Commission had said that it was going to draw up initial proposals this spring. Then, because of its resignation, it said that it was not going to do so until the autumn.', 'However, from the point of view of a Member who, although representing all of Spain, represents the interests of the outermost regions in particular, it is important that the Council should take steps to enable the new Commission to consider this issue from the beginning, since the special scheme requires further development.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, it is with good reason that the rules of the European Union give the right of initiative to the Commission. The Commission is not here at the moment, but it will certainly defend that right tooth and nail.', 'I would advise you to proceed as follows. A government with a particular interest in this matter could easily urge the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council as soon as possible and then I could assure you that the Council would consider the matter without any delay.', 'President.-', 'Question No 16 by Hans Lindqvist (H−0341/99)', 'Subject: Safe food', \"National campaigns on food safety and health are being conducted in all 15 Member States during the winter and spring. The original initiative was launched by the Commission's Directorate‐General for consumer policy, DG XXIV, which is also financing the campaign. The EU has made some SEK 1.3 million available for the campaign.\", 'We in Sweden have recently had to fight hard to avoid the EU practice of regularly using antibiotics as additives in animal feed.', 'Hitherto, Sweden has had strict rules on colouring in sweets, exacting standards of food quality control and stringent rules on crop spraying. Many EU rules are now forcing us to allow certain types of sweets despite their containing colouring that was previously banned in Sweden on public health grounds.', \"Does public health not always take priority? Should it not be the individual Member State's prerogative to decide what should be classified as safe or unsafe food?\", \"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Lindqvist's question.\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Lindqvist, the Council attaches great importance to food safety, especially in relation to protecting the health of the consumer. The Luxembourg European Council expressed this same concern in its statement on food safety. In that statement it stresses that the production and marketing of safe food must be one of the European Union\"s priorities and that a high level of health protection must be ensured. As I just said in reply to your Spanish colleague\"s question, it is up to the Commission to submit proposals to the Council for initiatives in this area.', 'For the rest let me say that if the Member States consider it necessary to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level, they may do so pursuant to Article 129a of the EC Treaty – new Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty – provided such measures are compatible with the other provisions of this Treaty. If a Member State takes further‐reaching measures of this kind, it must notify the Commission thereof. There are no further restrictions.', 'Lindqvist (ELDR). – (SV) I have tabled this question because my own country, Sweden, has quite strict food safety standards, both as regards home‐produced and imported products.', 'A number of decisions have now been taken in the EU which run counter to our interests. For instance, Sweden has been forced to follow the rules that apply to the Belgian Blue and to allow the species to be developed and also sold in Sweden. We have been forced to accept certain colouring agents in sweets and candies and in food products which could induce cancer and allergies, especially in children. Furthermore, meat contaminated with salmonella is crossing the border into Sweden.', \"The question I should like to put to the Council is this: should it not be obvious that every Member State should be entitled, in the interests of protecting people's health, to draw up rules which apply not just to home‐produced products but also to those which are imported? If it is a question of changing the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, then are we prepared to do that in order to reinforce our environmental safeguards?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Of course I can confirm that, Mr Lindqvist. And I have already answered that question by pointing out that a Member State has the right to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level. Naturally that includes measures such as those you mentioned. However, this must not create any barriers to trade or distortion of competition. Hence the rule that the Commission must be notified of any such measures so that it can examine that question.', 'I am happy to read out the relevant passage from the Amsterdam Treaty again. It is the fifth paragraph of Article 153, former Article 129a, and it reads: ‘Measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures. Such measures must be compatible with this Treaty. The Commission shall be notified of them.\" That is what I just explained to you. Compatibility with the Treaty relates to the question of barriers to trade and freedom of competition.', \"Sandbæk (I‐EDN). – (DA) With due respect, Mr President‐in‐Office, there really is something which you do not mention in your reply. It is true that a Member State can make use of a safeguard clause. This gives it six months in which to produce scientific evidence in order to maintain the more stringent basis which it requires in its own country. It is stated that this must not be a technical barrier to trade. You actually said that yourself in your reply. If it cannot be proved that there are grounds for the more stringent rules, then it will be regarded as a technical barrier to trade, and it is now expressly stated in the new environmental guarantee that if it can be proved that the tougher rule which is being sought at national level is actually in the consumers' interests, then the EU must adopt the regime. It is therefore not possible to maintain stricter rules unless evidence can be produced that they are necessary. In fact, Commissioner Bangemann also said this yesterday when we were discussing baby food. In some countries, things have been permitted because it has not been proved that a very small amount of pesticides in baby food is harmful, whereas other countries do not tolerate any pesticide residues at all. But Mr Bangemann stated categorically that he would not accept trade barriers. There should be clear scientific evidence on the table so that the Member States can maintain stricter rules.\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Sandbæk, we have a problem here. This is another question which seems out of context. I was asked about food safety and I did not say a word about the six‐month period you cite. I know nothing about this six‐month period; what I referred to was the Treaty provision on consumer protection. Your question relates to an environmental matter. That was not in the original question nor did I answer on the subject. If you have a question on the subject, I am sorry to say we did not receive it so I can only answer it in writing.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Verheugen. I am sure that Mrs Sandbæk hopes you will fulfil your promise to answer her question in writing.', 'President.-', 'Question No 17 by Arthur Newens (H−0343/99)', 'Subject: The EU/US banana dispute', \"Would the Council make a statement about the latest information from the WTO Disputes Panel investigating the EU banana regime and about the response that it will make to the Panel's conclusions?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Newens, first let me say that I hope this seemingly endless business is finally nearing its end now. At its meeting of 26 April 1999 the General Affairs Council emphasised that the European Union intends fully to respect the latest WTO ruling in the banana dispute and to amend the EU banana regime accordingly and without further ado. The Council therefore called on the Commission, in the light of further contacts with the USA and the other parties concerned, to submit proposals to amend the banana regime by the end of May 1999. Since we are not yet at the end of May, I am not in a position to tell you what form these proposals will take.', \"Newens (PSE). – Whilst thanking the President‐in‐Office for that reply, may I ask if it is envisaged that access for bananas from Lomé countries and the Canary Islands can still be adequately safeguarded, despite changes to bring the European Union's banana regime into conformity with the WTO ruling. Will the Council do everything possible to ensure this? – because it is crucial. Will not bananas otherwise constitute a precedent for other products of other less‐developed countries to lose their outlets, and will that not raise, in the long term, the issue of amendments to the world trade system to protect the poor against the multinationals?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Newens, with that question you have very accurately described the problem we are facing and that we have not managed to resolve so far. On the one hand we want to protect the banana producers with whom we have very close links; on the other hand, however, we have to respect the WTO rules. This dispute has now been going on for years and at some point one has to admit losing a dispute. The European Union has lost. It did not manage to win through here. The costs are quite considerable in any case, if you think of the punitive tariffs that have been imposed. Yet I am inclined to say that it is some satisfaction that the WTO has now markedly reduced the level of the punitive tariffs the USA may impose against the European Union. We are now paying 191.4 million dollars instead of the 520 million dollars the USA had originally fixed by unilateral procedure.', 'We have to wait for the Commission proposal to see how the Commission manages to reconcile the two requirements you mentioned: protection of the producer, especially the poorer producer, and conformity with the WTO rules. I really cannot predict that today.', 'President.-', 'Question no 18 by Anna Karamanou (H --0345/99)', 'Subject: Rising death toll and appalling living conditions in Iraq', \"The President of the Medical Association for the Prevention of War, Mrs Sue Wareham, recently claimed that between 4 500 and 6 000 children are dying every month in Iraq of hunger and disease owing to the terrible shortage of food and medicines. The doctors stress that most deaths are caused by infections of the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems which, under normal circumstances, would be completely curable. Food and medicines are officially exempt from the sanctions imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait but the bureaucratic structure of the procurement system and the country's limited earnings from the legal sale of oil restrict imports. At the same time, the regime is exploiting the distress of the population as a weapon to have sanctions lifted completely with no concessions on its part. In what way will the Council intervene to ensure the effective protection of human rights in Iraq, in particular in the light of the UN Security Council's debate on the lifting of economic sanctions?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Karamanou, this is an extremely serious question and the Council is grateful to you for giving it an opportunity to address this issue in the European Parliament. The European Union is aware of the effects of the sanctions on the food situation and on health care in Iraq. The Council has for a long time been deeply concerned about the situation of the civilian population in Iraq and especially the children. That is why the Council has always supported the Security Council\"s offer, which Iraq initially turned down, to permit the sale of oil in return for humanitarian imports. Ever since the ‘oil for food\" programme was implemented in late 1996, the Member States of the European Union have chaired the Security Council\"s committee on sanctions against Iraq and always sought the flexible application and continual improvement of the programme.', 'The European Union and its Member States are also playing their part in trying to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq. But the crucial point of reference is and remains the ‘oil for food\" programme. At the 55th meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 to 30 April this year the European Union took the initiative in drafting a resolution on the human rights situation; this calls inter alia on the Iraqi leadership to cooperate further in carrying out the ‘oil for food\" programme and to ensure the fair distribution of the humanitarian imports.', 'The Union also continues to support any initiatives to further improve the operation of the ‘oil for food\" programme and in this respect refers specifically to the proposals submitted by the UN Security Council panel on 30 March 1999 on the humanitarian situation in Iraq.', 'While most of the initial administrative difficulties of the ‘oil for food\" programme have been ironed out, the main problem with the programme is now Iraq\"s poor export capacity and the distribution of the medical aid. Iraq\"s export capacity is now being improved under a sub‐programme of the ‘oil for food\" programme, but it will not take full effect until spring 2000 because of the planning and delivery schedules; here, as you know, oil prices are a factor of uncertainty in both directions.', 'According to information from the United Nations, medical aid to the value of 275 million dollars is currently blocked in Iraqi warehouses although it is urgently needed by the population. Responsibility for this lies with the Iraqi Government. That illustrates the point made in Mrs Karamanou\"s question that the Saddam Hussein regime is exploiting the distress of the population as a weapon to have sanctions lifted without fulfilling the cease‐fire requirements of Resolution 687 of 1991.', 'That means the Iraqi leadership is responsible for the inadequate implementation of the ‘oil for food\" programme, just as it is responsible for the fact that the sanctions still cannot be lifted after running for over eight years. Let me remind you that in 1991 all the experts could and did assume that Iraq could have complied with Resolution 687 on a basis of full cooperation within the space of a few months. We are dealing here with a conflict between the humanitarian principle and the principle of national sovereignty, both of which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter, which restricts our means of action. But let me leave you in no doubt that we can only condemn the conduct of the Iraqi state leadership as utterly inhumane.', 'Karamanou (PSE). – (EL) Thank you, Mr President‐in‐Office, for your information. I would also like to congratulate the European Union on the initiatives it has taken and on the recent Geneva summit.', 'However, I think we need to accept that America must change its Middle East policy. I would like you to tell me, Mr President‐in‐Office, whether the Council considers that the achievement of political and military objectives can ignore the cost in terms of human lives. I would also like your opinion on whether, in the case of Iraq, the Vienna Convention, which prohibits the starvation of citizens as an instrument of war, is not being violated? Do you consider that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are not being violated? Six thousand innocent children are dying each month because of the embargo, and it is my conviction that no political objective can be placed above human lives.', 'Because I believe that we are, quite rightly, in favour of protecting human rights, I would like to ask you whether the innocent population of Iraq does not come under the heading of people to whom protection of human rights applies.', 'Finally, do you believe that this policy has weakened or, conversely, strengthened the position of Saddam Hussein, by analogy with what is happening in Kosovo and Serbia with regard to Mr Milosevic?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Karamanou, you are of course right to draw a parallel with the equally dreadful human rights situation in Kosovo, but in both cases we must after all look at cause and effect. In the case of Iraq it is clear that the sanctions were imposed on the basis of UN Security Council decisions. These sanctions were imposed because Iraq did not fulfil the necessary obligations for ensuring the security and stability of the region. But the programme I have described was permitted and was set in motion to ensure that these sanctions do not have the effect you described. I have also described the particular efforts being made by the European Union to ensure that this programme is effective. If it is not effective in certain areas, particularly in the area of medical care, the responsibility lies entirely with the Iraqi Government which has acted out of what are truly contemptible and base motives. Let me repeat: the Iraqi leadership wants to exploit this situation in order that the sanctions, which have a quite different political purpose, may be lifted. We must call on Iraq to fulfil its responsibility towards its own people.', 'Newens (PSE). – Does the President‐in‐Office accept that the ‘oil for food\" programme, while commendable, has many bureaucratic shortcomings and accompanying sanctions which still stop the needs of children from being met, while their parents can do very little to get rid of the inhuman dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.', 'In these circumstances it really is not acceptable to justify the actions taken by the West by putting the blame just on Saddam Hussein – we all accept that. Something still has to be done and more has to be done to meet the needs of these children.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Newens, you are making a political statement here and all I can do is to respectfully take note of your opinion and to bring it up at the next Council meeting on the situation in Iraq. I take a different view from you, but that is not the point here. Your question made one point I want to address, the question of possible bureaucratic obstacles to implementing the humanitarian programme. I agree: they did exist, which is why we have begun to streamline this programme, although this has not produced satisfactory results to date.', 'President.-', 'Question No 19 By María Izquierdo Rojo (H - 0349/99)', 'Subject: Presidential elections in Algeria', 'What political assessment does the Council make of the Algerian presidential elections of 15 April 1999?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the European Union followed the presidential elections in Algeria with great attention and made a statement on them. It goes as follows. The election campaign raised considerable hope in Algeria and among its partners in the international community. By taking an active part in the election campaign, Algeria\"s citizens showed the store they set by a free, open, pluralist poll, as promised by the Algerian authorities.', 'The European Union has noted the decision by six of the seven candidates to withdraw from the election and the reasons given by them for their decision. The European Union has supported and encouraged the democratisation process embarked upon in Algeria since 1995. The Union believes that it is by promoting democracy and the rule of law and by continuing with economic and social reforms that Algeria will be able to emerge from the crisis in which it has been embroiled for a number of years.', 'The European Union will attach the greatest importance to initiatives along these lines by the new President‐elect, Mr Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The European Union confirms its readiness to support the reform process in Algeria, particularly by way of Euro‐Mediterranean cooperation, and to continue the political dialogue entered into with the Algerian authorities.', 'Izquierdo Rojo (PSE). – (ES) Mr President‐in‐Office, using the same constructive approach that seems to underlie your response, could you tell me what exactly the European Union will do to help put an end to the violence and what measures it will adopt to help combat corruption in Algeria?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, first of all I am glad that we obviously agree on the need to continue with the policy we have already begun vis‐à‐vis Algeria, regardless of what we think of what happened before the presidential election there. By saying regardless I mean that we must endeavour to support a process of democratisation in Algeria and after all the preconditions there for the democratisation process are better than in many other countries suffering from a democratic deficit. There are strong democratic forces in Algeria and there is also a very free press there, and one which indeed makes use of that freedom. We must also say that up to the time when the six candidates withdrew, the electoral campaign had actually suggested that Algeria was moving towards democracy. It was in fact the case that all the candidates could put forward their programme freely and without restraint and that the political debate in Algeria took place in the kind of constructive atmosphere not seen for a long time. We also took particular note of the fact that one of the key issues of this Algerian electoral campaign was national reconciliation.', 'So we now conclude that in spite of the problem of which we are both aware, the movement towards a civil society in Algeria that began in the 1990s has in fact been boosted by the electoral campaign. I therefore think that we should do all we can in the form of political dialogue and political contacts to give further support to that process. In particular that means keeping in contact with the democratic forces in Algeria and supporting these forces, for instance by inviting them to the Member States of the European Union and to the European Parliament. It is important to demonstrate international protection and international support for the democratic forces in Algeria.', 'President.-', 'Question No 20 by Eva Kjer Hansen (HI-0351/99)', 'Subject: Appointment of officials without holding a competition', 'In its answer to my question about the plans to appoint staff from the Schengen Secretariat, the Council stated that, under Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, it is obliged to take on the staff of the Schengen Secretariat since the Protocol has to be regarded as part of the Treaty and hence as part of primary Community law.', 'However, Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol stipulates only that the Council must adopt the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council, i.e. the functions of the Schengen Secretariat and not necessarily its staff. To the extent that it is possible to envisage appointing existing Schengen Secretariat staff to the EU institutions, the provision in Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol in no way prevents the Council from appointing any staff interested in conformity with the existing rules of the Staff Regulations or from resorting to the alternative appointment procedure based on Article 24 of the Merger Treaty.', \"This being so, can the Council explain why it in this case still considers it legitimate both to flout the current Staff Regulations and to ignore the Commission's right of initiative laid down in Article 24 of the Merger Treaty?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, pursuant to Article 7 of the Protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty which integrates the Schengen acquis into the European Union, the Council decides by a qualified majority on the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council. On 1 May the Council took a decision laying down the details of the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat on the basis of that Article 7. According to my information, this legal case will in fact very soon be brought before the European Court of Justice, which is why this is all I can say by way of an answer. I will not become involved in a legal debate because that is a matter reserved to the appropriate Community jurisdiction. This question is now purely a matter for the Court of Justice to decide.', 'Let me however repeat that the Council\"s view is that the rules that have been adopted make every provision for guaranteeing the skills and competence of the individuals appointed. Given this situation and in view also of press reports that have also appeared today, let me point out that it is not the Secretary‐General of the Council who is responsible for the tensions we are currently seeing in the General Secretariat, but that the only reason for these tensions is a political decision by the Council that is covered by the Treaty. To hold the Secretary‐General responsible for that is, in my view, quite unfair and inappropriate in this situation.', 'Kjer Hansen (ELDR). – (DA) I would like to thank you for your reply, but I do not understand why the terms of the Staff Regulations are being disregarded, since there is after all nothing to prevent us from respecting the Council\"s existing rules during the integration process. There is no reason for us now to be recruiting large numbers of staff without them having to sit the recruitment tests, so I have still had no answer to my question as to why the existing rules are being disregarded. As far as I can see, this all smacks more of what one might call national nepotism, in other words that there are a number of Member States that wish to have some staff placed somewhere in particular, and the other Member States are therefore nodding this through. Can the President‐in‐Office tell me what justification there is for us now suddenly to start recruiting more staff than the 58 people who were originally deemed necessary? It seems to me highly reprehensible that the Council is venturing to disregard the existing rules. Is it not the case, Mr President‐in‐Office, that there is a need to analyse the situation within the Council with a view to cleaning things up and clearly documenting what requirements – and what resources – there are for ensuring that we get more openness and more transparency with regard to what takes place within the Council, just as we are demanding within the Commission?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mrs Kjer Hansen, nothing is happening behind the scenes here; we are talking about an entirely open and public process. The Treaty provides that the Schengen Secretariat will be integrated into the General Secretariat of the Council and that the Council will decide the detailed arrangements. That is what the Council has done!', 'I have to say again that the political intention of the Treaty was to integrate the existing Schengen Secretariat – without any new appointments being made or any selection procedures being initiated – into the existing General Secretariat because surely there would be no point in the integration of one secretariat with another secretariat meaning that we appointed 80 new staff according to the rules that apply to the General Secretariat and kicked out the 80 people who used to work for the Schengen Secretariat. I cannot imagine that the questioner would agree to such an inhuman and unsocial solution. Nothing is being done behind the scenes here; it is a very normal, open procedure. And I must say in all honesty that the Council cannot understand the resistance the General Secretariat staff is showing here.', 'President.-', 'Question No 21 by Pat Gallagher (H−0354/99)', 'Subject: Fishing fraud in southern Europe', \"Is the Council aware of the Auditors' report criticising the Commission for failing to take adequate precautions to prevent fraud involving EU funds for modernising fishing vessels, most of which are located in southern Europe? Is it aware that funds were given to renovate vessels that had already sunk or which would never be put in service again and that verification visits were minimal? Will the Council now make a clear commitment that every effort will be made to recover or, if necessary, to impose severe penalties for proven embezzlement?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, I can only answer this question in the affirmative. The Council received the Court of Auditors\" report on the formation of joint enterprises in the fisheries sector on 9 December 1998. The Council discussed the content of this report during the deliberations on the Commission proposal laying down detailed arrangements and conditions for Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. This Commission proposal contains various provisions aimed at removing the abuses listed in the Court of Auditors\" report on the management of joint enterprises. The presidency intends to take a final decision on this proposal at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June, provided that Parliament has given its opinion by that date. Looking at the agenda, it would seem that Parliament will be discussing that proposal this week.', \"Gallagher (UPE). – I was deeply disappointed to learn from the Auditors' report that millions of pounds of taxpayers' money seem to have been siphoned off by boat owners in southern Europe. It appears that the Commission has failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the alleged fraud. I understand that the missing funds were part of a EUR 280 million programme to modernise almost 200 fishing vessels. Grants were provided to refurbish and modernise boats which were expected to fish outside the Union.\", 'It is alleged that grants were paid to renovate vessels which were already sunk – grants were paid to renovate vessels that had little chance of going into active service. Indeed I understand that a grant was paid in respect of a fishing vessel that was submerged in the Atlantic off the coast of Portugal. Vessels were sunk under mysterious circumstances and rather than use the wide brush approach it is suggested that these were in Italy, Spain and Portugal.', 'I want to raise this point with the Commissioner, while he is awaiting specific provisions to address the problems both at management and operational level. I presume I can accept that the presidency condemns such actions. I take no pleasure in raising this. All of us have to take some responsibility because if it is necessary to provide additional staff Parliament must approve additional monies. All of us are involved in this and if you require additional monies to overcome this problem then we must vote for them.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Gallagher, I have already told you that the Council has drawn the necessary political and organisational conclusions in the light of the findings of the Court of Auditors\" report that you describe in such graphic detail. That is the Council\"s job and it has done it. The Council has to ensure that if problems of this kind arise measures are taken to prevent their recurrence.', 'On the concrete question of what is being done to minimise in some way the damage that has occurred and of the European Union possibly also taking legal action, that is a question for the Commission and not the Council. I am of course assuming that the Commission will take these very serious criticisms in the Court of Auditors\" report as grounds to pursue the European Union\"s interests as vigorously as possible.', 'President . – As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 22 and 23 lapse.', 'Gallagher (UPE). – Mr President, is it possible for Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Andrews, who are attending another meeting, to have written replies?', 'President . – No, Mr Gallagher, they must be here themselves. If they had notified me in writing that you or another Member of the House were to act as a substitute for the questions, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, then that would have been in order. However, in this case, the Rules limit answers in writing to those questions that we have not been able to cover during the hour and a half set aside for Question Time.', 'President.-', 'Question No 24 by Liam Hyland (H−0360/99)', 'Subject: Backing a new LEADER III programme', 'Will the Council outline its present policy with regard to the development of a fully integrated rural policy at EU level and will it give assurances that, as a part of such a policy, it will continue to support a new LEADER programme (III) and the retention of its name which is synonymous with empowerment and self‐help and a positive image of the European Union? Furthermore, will it ensure a consistent approach to rural development by maintaining the same Local Action Groups, thereby helping to avoid long lead‐in times which can cause serious setbacks in development momentum?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Hyland, the aim of the proposal in the agriculture section of Agenda 2000 for a regulation on rural development is to regenerate the rural areas and simplify the agriculture rules. The reform of the Structural Funds, which includes the agreed reduction of the number of Objectives from six to three, will make it easier to achieve this aim. This has already been discussed in depth here today.', 'On that basis rural development policy can gradually establish itself as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. In that context, the Leader Community initiative will be continued in the form of Leader III. Leader III aims to make rural development more dynamic overall by supporting the programme of innovative projects by local groups. Overlaps between Leader and measures under the rural development regulation will be prevented by the fact that the rural development regulation concerns national or regional support measures, but not local measures. Leader projects, by contrast, remain reserved to local action groups. Let me also point out that this question is a subject of the debate we have interrupted with Question Time.', 'Hyland (UPE). – Mr President, I should like to thank the President‐in‐Office for his reply. But I have to ask a supplementary question. Will LEADER retain its identity and independence as a Community initiative with a high level of voluntary Community participation? Will the President‐in‐Office take steps to ensure that it is not absorbed into national or regional statutory structures but is seen by those agencies as an important but independent development programme?', 'A very important part of my question concerns the continuity of LEADER. We are anxious to ensure that there will be no delay between the ending of the present LEADER II and the beginning of LEADER III. Otherwise a lot of very professional staff who have been recruited over the years will be lost to the programme. This would be a very serious mistake to make.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Hyland, let me herewith give you the assurances you want in relation to all three parts of your supplementary.', 'President.-', 'Question No 25 by Gerard Collins (H−0364/99)', 'Subject: Kuwaiti prisoners of war in Iraq', 'Although nine years have passed since the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, the 598 Kuwaiti men and 7 women who were deported remain in Iraqi prisons. UN Security Council Resolution 687 called on Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross in order to release these prisoners of war. Iraq has persistently obstructed the work of the ICRC by withholding information, failing to attend meetings and preventing the ICRC from inspecting Iraqi prisons. What steps has the Council taken to‐date to alleviate the plight of the 605 Kuwaiti POWs and what intervention with the Iraqi authorities or other measures does it propose to take to address this humanitarian issue?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Collins, the Council shares your concern about the problem of the disappeared persons, including the prisoners of war, who fell victim to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. At the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 March to 30 April 1999, the European Union submitted a draft resolution calling on Iraq to cooperate with the appropriate international organisations and to provide information on the whereabouts or fate of the remaining disappeared persons.', 'We called for compensation to be paid to the families of those who have died in Iraqi prisons or have disappeared. All Kuwaitis or other nationals who are still in prison must be released at once. Families must be notified of the whereabouts of prisoners. We also call on Iraq to provide information on death sentences carried out on prisoners of war or civilian prisoners, including the death certificates of prisoners of war or civilian prisoners who have died. I do not think more can be done in this matter. You know as well as I that unfortunately we are not in a position to force Iraq to comply with these demands.', 'Collins, Gerard (UPE). – Mr President, I wish to thank the President‐in‐Office for the information he has given. It all boils down to the fact that other than putting forward a draft resolution at the 55th human rights meeting in Geneva, where we stated our position, we have done nothing else since because we have no information whatsoever with regard to the 598 Kuwaiti men and seven women who were sent to Iraqi prisons. Is there any further pressure that the Council and the European Union would consider putting on the Iraqi authorities in an effort at least to get information as to how many of these people are alive, who they are, what is the state of their health, when they are going to be released and, indeed, how many have died. Can we do anything in a positive way at this particular time nine years later?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Collins, I will not conceal from you that I am very pessimistic about this. Efforts have been going on for a long time now and the European Union has stepped them up. In my answer I did not even list all the initiatives we have already taken. There are a number of others. There is also a new initiative by the United Nations Security Council. The situation remains unchanged and I cannot see what other means of pressure we can apply against a country on which we have already imposed the most far‐reaching sanctions at our disposal.', 'President.-', 'Question No 26 by Per Gahrton (H−0365/99)', 'Subject: Interpretation in Council', \"The TT news agency reported on 30 March 1999 that, in three cases out of four, Swedish representatives in the Council are compelled to negotiate in a foreign language during Council meetings. According to the report, interpretation in English, German and French is almost standard. To express oneself in a language other than one's mother tongue must be regarded as a distinct disadvantage in negotiations. Can the Council, therefore, confirm or deny these reports and say whether it will take measures to ensure that Swedish is treated in the same way as the major languages in the EU and that Swedish representatives are able to express themselves in Swedish and rely on being interpreted in the future?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mr Gahrton, the Council is aware of the news agency report you quote. Unfortunately that report about Council meetings and Swedish interpreters is undated and provides no further details. Given the almost countless number of Council bodies that have met on such countless occasions recently, with the best will in the world the presidency has been unable to find out which Council meetings and which dates are being referred to. So we have not been able to look into the actual incidents in question.', 'In regard to interpretation from Swedish in principle, let me say that a Council programme exists, and has also been forwarded to the Swedish Government, on the appointment and training of interpreters in the Swedish language and that this programme is now under way.', 'Gahrton (V). – (SV) Thank you for your reply, even though it was not really much of an answer. I mentioned in my question that the report had come from the Swedish news agency, TT, on 30 March this year. I assume that what they refer to must have taken place a relatively short time before. However, the question was not about a particular occurrence, but a generally held view that all too often no provision is made for the Swedish language when Swedish representatives are taking part in Council meetings. It is therefore extraordinary that the Council should not be more aware of a situation which has provoked quite an intense debate in Sweden. Indeed, I think one might have been better informed before coming here to answer questions.', 'In any event, for one of the Member States it is a most important question. Suspicion is already rife that there are plans to do away with the minority languages altogether in the EU context. It would therefore be helpful if the Council could give a more positive assurance that, in its own work, it is not the case that it is systematically endeavouring to screen out the minority languages and taking advantage of the fact that some of the Swedish representatives are probably able to express themselves in another language.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, Mr Gahrton, all I can tell you is that I myself have never attended a Council meeting at which Swedish was not interpreted from start to finish. If you have information to the effect that this is not the case, I would be grateful if you could pass it on to me. The presidency of the Council does not have such information and we did look into the press report you cite but were unable to find out when and where this is supposed to have happened.', 'Nor does the presidency have any kind of complaint before it from Sweden that its language is neglected at Council meetings. May I perhaps advise you not necessarily to rely on an anonymous press agency report but to accept the official statement the Council presidency is giving you here. So if you do have information, I would be grateful if you could pass it on and then we would look into the matter. The principle of course applies that no Member State may be placed at a disadvantage by negotiations not being interpreted in its language.', 'President . – As the author is not present, Question No 27 lapses.', 'Question No 28 by Marianne Eriksson (H−0368/99)', 'Subject: Commissioner for equality', 'In accordance with Articles 2, 3 137(1) and 141 of the Amsterdam Treaty, the EU is to take up equality between the sexes as an extremely serious issue. There are many, in fact, who say that this matter should be given top priority. In the light of these considerations, will the Council say how it envisages achieving an even distribution of the sexes among the future Commissioners and what its views are on appointing a Commissioner solely responsible for equality?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Eriksson, let me first emphasise that the Council attaches very great importance to measures to promote equal opportunities for men and women and to the practical implementation of the appropriate provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, which applies to all the bodies, organs and institutions we have in Europe, from the European Parliament to the Commission and to the Council itself. But I am sorry to have to point out that the Member States are solely responsible for proposing the members of the European Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Treaties and that the distribution of tasks within the Commission is in fact an internal Commission matter. The Council has no part whatsoever to play in this connection, and I am not even saying: ‘unfortunately no part whatsoever\". The Commission\"s sovereign right to organise its own affairs is an important aspect of integration policy in the Union and we should not jeopardise it by prescribing to the Commission from the outside how it should organise itself.', 'Eriksson (GUE/NGL). – (SV) In spite of everything, I find it rather depressing, at this last part‐session of Parliament, to have to witness such a passive approach to coordination, something which the Council is otherwise glad to recommend. I am definitely not satisfied with the answer. In my view, after all the criticism which has been levelled at the lack of progress in promoting equality of opportunity between men and women, the Council should be more active in initiating discussions and ensuring that there are more than the three, or possibly four, women candidates currently rumoured to be in the running. It is a frightening thought, given that we are about to enter the new millennium, which everyone says should herald something genuinely new, that we are still being confronted with something old.', 'I also expected to hear whether there had been any discussion of what should now be done to give genuinely active encouragement to equality of opportunity following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, Article 13 of which covers all groups, including women, in terms of anti‐discrimination.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Eriksson, I quite understand your strong feelings and your comment, but the Council will not be tempted even by Members of the European Parliament to infringe the Treaties. The Treaties are quite unambiguous here. The Council does not have the right to exert any influence on this question.', 'Hautala (V). – (FI) Mr President, the State Secretary, Mr Verheugen, is behaving like a true diplomat: he avoids the issue that the President‐in‐Office is clearly in a position to negotiate with Member States on the matter of the balanced appointment of male and female candidates to the Commission. Mr Verheugen, you may have noticed that on 23 March the European Parliament indicated its desire for a substantially greater proportion of women Members of the next Commission than there is at present. I would like to ask you this: will you in no way take responsibility for this? You are perfectly capable of promoting this aim in negotiations with the Member States. The Commission\"s new President, Mr Prodi, has already discovered that we in the House are quite serious about this. Today, in a press conference, he stated he was giving this issue his attention. You could work in cooperation with him. But is it your intention to negotiate with the Member States?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mrs Hautala, you must have misunderstood me if you say my answer was diplomatic. It was meant to be anything but diplomatic. I wanted to make it clear that however noble and right a political concern may be, the Council cannot assume powers that it does not have. The same applies to the presidency. The situation is not what you think. The presidency does not have the power to negotiate with the Member States about who they send to Brussels as a member of the Commission. The President of the Commission whose appointment you confirmed today has that power, and that President of the Commission, who was also selected on the basis of whether he can effectively assert the rights that he has, is pursuing the aim to which you referred. The presidency also has great sympathy for that aim, but unfortunately there is nothing at all it can do about it. Since the office of presidency is filled by a country that can appoint two Commissioners, it can only ensure that the principle you called for is observed by its own country. But unfortunately I have no means of doing the same for Sweden because Sweden only appoints one Commissioner, which means it is rather difficult to apply the quota system in this case.', 'President.-', 'Question No 29 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H−0369/99)', 'Subject: Protection of persons providing information', 'Before the Commission resigned, Paul van Buitenen, the internal auditor, was suspended from duty on half pay. Since then, he has obtained a new post in another Commission department. This and similar cases raise the question of the need to allow Commission staff the freedom to provide information, which in Sweden, for example, is a right enshrined in the constitution.', \"Does the Council consider that the right of Commission staff to provide information should now be a matter for debate in the light of events prior to the Commission's resignation?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) I am a little confused, Mr President. Are we talking about Mr van Buitenen? Is that the question?', 'President . – This is Question No 29 on protection of persons providing information.', 'But Yes Indeed, Mr. Sjöstedt is referring to Mr. Paul van Buitenen.', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) In reply to Mr Sjöstedt\"s question, let me emphasise that the internal organisation of the Commission is the affair of that institution alone. As for the Council, it has never had call to act in the kind of situation addressed by the questioner. On the contrary, in what are fortunately rare cases, the Council\"s administration has felt obliged to take strong action against officials who have not respected the necessary professional rules of conduct in the course of their duties.', 'Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL). – (SV) I should like to thank the Council for its answer. To my mind, the right of officials to denounce and publicly criticise irregularities is not an internal matter of staff regulations and so on, but is in fact a fundamental question of openness.', \"There is soon to be a new intergovernmental conference which will provide opportunities for further strengthening openness within the Union, a process that has already begun with the formulation of rules on access to documents. One such possibility would of course be to strengthen the right of employees to denounce irregularities and express criticism without being silenced or actively penalised, as was the case in the Commission. I should be glad to hear the Council's views on this, in other words whether openness can be further developed in the European Union.\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) The Council cannot make any statement about the internal organisation of the Commission. That is the Commission\"s own business. The Council could give its view if this incident had concerned its own staff. But that is not the case. No such problem has arisen within the Council. Nor can I make any judgment because obviously the personal files or disciplinary measures relating to Commission staff are not available to the Council. It is quite impossible for me to judge what actually happened in this case. You will have to address this question to the Commission. And indeed you can easily do so. The Council cannot make any comment.', 'President . – Thank you, Mr Verheugen.

What is the current position as regards granting a negotiating mandate to the Commission?\", 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr President, regarding the possible upgrading of contractual relations between the European Union and Croatia, I believe the honourable Member is aware that this comes under the EU\"s regional approach, as set out in the General Affairs Council\"s conclusions of 29 April 1997. Twice a year the Council examines whether the requirements set in that respect have been fulfilled.', 'After its last examination on the basis of the conditions set on 9 November 1998, the Council decided that Croatia should continue to be granted autonomous trade preferences but that the conditions for assistance under the PHARE programme had not been met and that it was also too soon to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement. Any improvement in relations, including possible future negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement, will depend on whether Croatia makes further progress towards meeting the required conditions. At this moment I cannot foresee when the fulfilment of these conditions will next be checked.', 'In regard to your broader question about the general stability of the region, on 26/27 April 1999 the Council agreed to begin preparing a stability pact for south‐eastern Europe. The EU is vigorously pursuing this task. It is doing so in cooperation with the appropriate international organisations and regional initiatives and in particular with the states of that region, with the initial aim of holding a conference on the stability pact for south‐eastern Europe at senior official level; this will be convened by the presidency of the European Union in Bonn on 27 May 1999.', 'The stability pact will offer all the Balkan states a concrete prospect of stability and integration into the Euro‐Atlantic structures. I myself will be in Croatia next week as the representative of the presidency to discuss the development of relations between the EU and Croatia with the Croatian Government, the Croatian Parliament and Croatian political parties.', 'Posselt (PPE). – (DE) Thank you, Mr President‐in‐Office, for that very detailed and informative reply. Yet I do have a supplementary. You said that a decision was taken on 9 November during the bi‐annual consideration of the question. If my calculations are right, six months have elapsed since then but you said you could not foresee when the next six‐monthly check would take place. So I just wanted to ask: have I misunderstood something or has the timetable changed in some way? I also wanted to ask another question. Serious events have occurred since 9 November, namely the war in Kosovo, which after all has radically changed things. I do agree that Croatia must fulfil certain conditions – and indeed it has already fulfilled many of them, while there are others that it has not – but I see no reason to place Croatia in a worse contractual position than, for instance, Albania or Macedonia, which are also politically very unstable and problematic countries, while Croatia is after all an emerging democracy. That is my view but my actual question is this: when will the next decisions be taken?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Posselt, in reply to your supplementary I have to say that the Commission is indeed running late. I shall take your question as an opportunity to urge the Commission to keep to the six‐monthly date. On your second question, the purpose of my trip to Croatia is precisely to find out whether what you say is true. I am quite prepared to notify you of the results of the talks in Zagreb directly and in confidence.', 'President . – As the author is not present, Question No 31 lapses.', 'I should now like to appeal to your generosity, Mr President‐in‐Office.

I have totally different numbers from you. That is what makes matters so difficult. But I have now found the question, because Mr Brian Crowley\"s name is on it.', 'Mr Crowley, in reply to your question, let me refer you to the Council\"s common position as adopted on 14 April and forwarded to the European Parliament that same day. In it, the Council stated that it was against earmarking a minimum amount of 1\\u2009% of ESF resources for fairly small subsidies to non‐governmental organisations. The Council regarded the Commission proposal to that effect as too inflexible and replaced the 1\\u2009% by what it referred to as an appropriate amount. However, the Council intends to amend its common position and to provide for a possible 100\\u2009% cofinancing of these subsidies. That would create an incentive for using European Social Fund appropriations for subsidies to non‐governmental organisations.', 'Crowley (UPE). – Mr President, I should like to thank the President‐in‐Office for his response. However it is with some concern that I see that they have changed the common position in particular. The reason why we looked for the 1\\u2009% of the ESF to be ringfenced for these kind of actions is that we were afraid that if it were left for the Council to decide, no money would be made available to the NGOs and for these other actions. We are working exclusively from the experience which we already have from the peace and reconciliation programme in Northern Ireland, also from some of the environmental programmes which have been so successful where the NGOs have taken the lead and been given assistance from European Union funding. We are afraid that these monies will be denied to them in the future. Could we have a guarantee from the President‐in‐Office that, whilst they may not agree with the ringfencing of 1\\u2009%, they will give a definite commitment that there will be a percentage available when the new ESF operation comes into being?', 'Verheugen, Council. – (DE) Mr Crowley, obviously I cannot give you that commitment. And you know that, because it would mean suspending the existing Council decision. I am quite prepared to put your arguments to the Council again and to reconsider them. But let me tell you that I do not agree with your assessment of the matter. I think the formula the Council has opted for tends to increase rather than reduce the possibilities of the funding you call for.', 'President.- Thank you, mr.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the time set aside for questions to the Council.

Both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner delivered their opinions this afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, you will continue the debate this evening with a general discussion. The European Parliament\"s political discussions on Agenda 2000 will then come to a close with tomorrow\"s vote. The conclusion will be, as it were, a tailor‐made one because by approving the Agenda 2000 proposals the European Parliament is laying the foundations, during the final part‐session of both this parliamentary term and the German Presidency, for the future development of the European Union and not least the future common agricultural policy. However, this decision will also bring to an end a discussion which has occupied both politicians and professional groups in all the Member States for two years.', 'Since the Commission presented its statement entitled ‘Agenda 2000 – a stronger and wider Union\" in spring 1997, an all‐out effort has been made to change the direction of the common agricultural policy. I should like to point out in particular that the European Parliament has made its position on this absolutely clear from the outset. It has claimed a constructive role in the process through the resolutions it has adopted and, in particular, by taking up positions of substance. When you deliver your opinion tomorrow on the decisions of both the agricultural ministers and the Heads of State and Government, you will be adopting a reform which clearly bears the European Parliament\"s mark as well. Even though many people would have wished for more far‐reaching decisions in one area or another, we should perhaps accept that this reform meets the demands made on it. I will mention four main areas.', 'A maximum of EUR 297 billion will be made available for the agricultural budget during the period 2000‐2006. Agricultural expenditure in real terms will therefore still be limited to the present level. The reform of the common agricultural policy and pre‐accession aid also prepare the Community for enlargement eastward in the agricultural sector. The common agricultural policy\"s stronger orientation towards the market and the environment will equip the Community with an offensive negotiating strategy at the forthcoming round of WTO negotiations. It can also use this to defend the European model of agriculture with its high standards of quality, safety and protection.', 'Measures to promote rural development have been extended considerably and can now be developed into a second pillar of the common agricultural policy.', 'In view of the complexity of the subject matter and the obvious conflicts of interest in this area between the Member States as well, I think it was not to be taken for granted that the negotiations on the agricultural part of Agenda 2000 would be concluded successfully.', 'It is the result of hard work, but I think it is first and foremost the result of the exemplary form of cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council which was based on trust and was always constructive. It has also been a matter of concern for me from the outset to promote the dialogue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Perhaps you will agree with me that in the informal conciliation procedure we have developed an instrument which in the past few months has proved to be exemplary. In addition to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, information has been exchanged on a regular basis, allowing you, ladies and gentlemen, to be kept up to date on the Council\"s views. The agricultural ministers have also been kept fully informed of your opinions. In particular, I would add that, as President‐in‐Office of the Council, the position of the European Parliament was always a very useful trump card when seeking solutions during the negotiations.', 'We have reached the end of a long and – we should not conceal this fact – sometimes difficult journey. I believe that we have taken a decision to the best of our knowledge and beliefs which should be of use to Europe and its citizens. This is definitely a joint project, and I hope very much that it will also be a joint success.', 'May I thank you all for your support and trust in me. I am thinking particularly of Mr Fischler here, and the contribution he made during the negotiations. I should like to stress this point. This kind of cooperation based on trust has been most gratifying, even though it took up a great deal of our time, sometimes into the night. I also thank all those who participated. In spite of all the controversy which we dealt with, it was always clear that there was a joint effort to make decisions. In particular, the way in which we argued with each other in order to make these decisions speaks for itself. I think it was described by everyone as appropriate and friendly. I sensed this from the reactions of various people who participated in the project too.', 'President . – It is not for the Chair to make comments on the substance of what you have said, but I believe that the Chair has a duty to thank you and your colleagues in the German Presidency.

We acknowledge this, and would like to thank you for all you have done.', 'Jové Peres (GUE/NGL). – (ES) Mr President, the implementation of the Berlin agreements will mean that the process of farms disappearing and jobs being destroyed, which already started with the 1992 reform, will become more pronounced. In addition, this process will largely affect small and medium‐sized farms, as they will be only partially compensated through income aid.', 'Furthermore – and this is the worst element, in my group\"s view – no means of correcting the existing imbalances between continental and Mediterranean production and between small and large farms has been introduced. The financial allocations for continental production are being increased again, while those for Mediterranean production remain frozen.', 'The scheme approved in Berlin will also have a severe negative impact on the social fabric of the countryside.', 'Do the Commission and the Council really expect the timid rural development measures to compensate for that impact? The rural development measures proposed are going to be implemented to give preferential treatment to the richer Member States that have a smaller percentage of farmers. In addition, the Commission\"s proposal will exclude fruit and vegetable growers from the benefits of the rural development measures.', 'I am absolutely astonished that Parliament\"s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected an amendment tabled by my group to correct this situation and that the amendment was declared inadmissible in the House pursuant to Rule 60 of the Rules of Procedure. It is just as well that, in this case, the Berlin European Council did intend to correct that point, highlighting the paradox of what happened in Parliament\"s Committee on Agriculture.', 'There have been CAP reforms since 1992 intended, presumably, to correct the uneven economic support granted to small and large farms. In the wake of the Commission\"s timid proposal, the Berlin agreements are a step backwards in terms of limiting aid to large farms and increasing support to small and medium‐sized farms.', 'The Committee on Agriculture\"s position represents no progress in that direction either, and I must say once again that it is unfortunate that an amendment by my group on modifications to the aid was declared inadmissible.', 'As a result, my political group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, will not support a reform of the CAP which will actually mean that its main imbalances will become more marked.', 'van Dam (I‐EDN). – (NL) Mr President, this concluding debate on Agenda 2000 should be limited to the main thrust of the reforms. If we now try to bring controversial amendments we risk bringing down the whole Berlin package like a house of cards. I am thinking, for example, of the amendment in the Görlach report to increase setting‐up aid from EUR 25 000 to EUR 35 000. A number of Member States simply cannot accept such cost‐increasing proposals.', 'The central question today is: do we accept the financial basis of Agenda 2000 and are we going to confirm this in an interinstitutional agreement? My answer is a straightforward ‘Yes\". If the Union wants to give applicant countries the real prospect of accession we must look at how this is to be financed. The financial perspective agreed in Berlin is essential for this. The Council has succeeded in drawing up an efficient multiannual budget, thus creating the financial scope for enlargement. I do, however, have great difficulty with certain elements of the package, such as the Council\"s unfortunate insistence that the ceiling on structural expenditure must also be a target. But all things considered, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.', 'I do not believe that recourse to Article 203 of the Treaty, which is what many Members of Parliament were calling for, is the right way forward, since it would result in an increase in the Union\"s expenditure which net contributors in particular would find unacceptable. My principal objection to the use of Article 203 is, however, that it would effectively mean making the financing of enlargement dependent upon the uncertain outcomes of the annual budgetary conflicts between the Council and European Parliament. This is completely unacceptable.', 'Amadeo (NI). – (IT) Mr President, before this Parliament is dissolved it will have succeeded in expressing its opinion on the launch of the Structural Funds reform. It will have succeeded in moving forward from positions which threatened to produce yet another trial of strength between the European institutions. After repeated misunderstandings with the Commission on the progress of the work, which threatened to discredit the efforts being made, we are finally together not only on the texts of the new regulations but on a starting point for active collaboration in the management of the Funds through the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament on the implementation of the structural policies. Parliament has had an important voice in defining the guidelines for this reform, but it must have an even more important one throughout the programming period.', 'We are glad the Council accepted Parliament\"s request to restore URBAN as one of the Community initiatives, albeit at the end of the negotiations. That was not obstinacy on our part as Members of Parliament, it was simply recognising the key role of urban areas in regional development. The balanced and complementary development of urban and rural areas is essential for economic and regional development. This means intensifying cooperation at all levels with the regional and local authorities and socio‐economic operators closest to the evolving situation in the region. Greater competitiveness between regions must take account of the risks of imbalance caused by the differences in levels of employment and human resources, in infrastructure quality, in the natural environment and in development, especially in the delicate phase we are now entering with the identification of regions eligible for Objective 2.', 'We are in favour of reform, generally speaking, but we do have certain reservations about grey areas not yet examined in depth – for example, the impact on the regions whose development process will be put on hold for the sake of the principle of concentration. The people of these areas will be penalised, and that hardly helps to demonstrate that the European Union is working for the development of the less‐favoured regions. Actually my own country, Italy, is likely to be seriously penalised by the calculation of the Objective 2 ceiling: added to the guaranteed maximum reduction of 33\\u2009% there is the reduction caused by the inclusion of the regions coming out of Objective 1.', 'Izquierdo Collado (PSE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying how concerned I am that it looks as if major efforts are being made to ensure that the financial perspective can be approved tomorrow by Parliament without a qualified majority. I hope that that does not prove to be the case because it would be an inadequate end to a subject as important as the one we are debating this evening.', 'The problem is that we are debating ‘how\" and ‘how much\" at the same time. And we may agree on ‘how\" but not on ‘how much\". Yet tonight we have to decide on both aspects at once.', 'I want to refer specifically to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the cohesion policies. I agree with the ‘how\", exactly as planned by the Commissioner, and I would also like to take this opportunity once again to congratulate the Commissioner and DG XVI. We have worked closely with her and she has helped us immensely in moving cohesion forward during these past five years and, I believe, also for the years ahead. I agree with the report by Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs McCarthy in relation to Objective 1, coordination and partnership projects, and so on. So Mrs Wulf‐Mathies and Mr Eneko Landaburu have not only the support, but also the appreciation of the parliamentary committee that has worked with them on these issues.', 'But we are entering an era where the European Union has more powers. It has a codecision procedure, a single currency and a single market, and we want improved cohesion and a worthy enlargement. We want social policies, policies on employment, on rural development and on trans‐European networks. And what does the Council offer us in its Berlin negotiations? It offers us a move from that mythical figure of 1.27\\u2009% – which was so difficult to get past – to 0.97\\u2009%. It offers us a reduction and a de facto renationalisation of the funds the European Union needs, and I have to say that quite a few Members will say ‘no\" to the Council tomorrow, precisely on the issue of the financial perspective.', 'Rack (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, in Parliament\"s view the decision‐making procedure for Agenda 2000 deserves to be praised and to be met with approval. In view of the timetable for ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, the Council and the Commission have already agreed that as far as possible, the European Parliament should be granted those rights to which it has only formally been entitled since 1 May this year, particularly in the area of structural reform.', 'As the European Parliament and perhaps also as representatives of the Member States, we can agree under these circumstances, and with a clear conscience, to the results of Agenda 2000 and the decision‐making procedure regarding this. The most important objectives which the Commission had already envisaged are entirely reasonable. Concentrating on the real problems and problem areas, less bureaucratic structures, and greater efficiency and transparency generally make good sense.', 'If other important practical, national and regional concerns have been dealt with in addition to this, the matter is a really coherent one. In this respect, as a representative of my country, I welcome the special consideration given to rural development under the new Objective 2. I also approve of the new phasing‐out regulation for former Objective 1, 2 and 5b regions where regeneration has almost been achieved but a little bit more is needed.', 'I welcome the new Interreg regulation in particular, because we have worked long and hard on it, and I hope in particular that the regions bordering with the applicant countries at the EU\"s external borders will take advantage of the time and money available. At any rate, for Austria this amounts to ATS 5 billion over the next seven years.', 'My enthusiasm for Agenda 2000 is limited on one decisive issue. Is it really justifiable to celebrate the fact that we all want Europe to cost us less in the future as one of the most successful conclusions of Berlin at a time when we are all rightly calling for more European integration in employment, structural reform in general, the EU enlargement process, and solidarity for the wider Europe? Is 1\\u2009% of Europe\"s gross domestic product really too much for the Member States to pay when national quotas are 40\\u2009% or more? I do not think so!', 'Boogerd‐Quaak (ELDR). – (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my appreciation for the fact that so many Commissioners are still present at this late hour. I see this as a sign of esteem for the European Parliament, as also is the presence of German Minister Funke. This too should be acknowledged. It shows that you are ready to listen, at whatever hour Parliament calls its speakers.', 'Mr Flynn, you naturally called for support for the proposals to reform the European Social Fund. My group will certainly be doing so, and will also be supporting Mrs Jöns\"s proposals. When it comes to employment and job creation we must all join together to do the best we can. But at the same time we cannot deny that a large group in society is in need of special attention, and by this I mean people in a disadvantaged position, such as women and minorities. This is expressed in Parliament\"s amendments, and it was particularly the Council that was not too keen on it. I hope that we can work together to achieve further progress in this area.', 'This brings me to something which is very close to my heart: the European Social Fund and also, Mr Fischler, the new budget for rural development. I very much welcome them both. I believe the European Social Fund is a means of giving impetus to job creation in Europe, just as the fund for rural development is something which should facilitate the major changes which large sections of the farming sector have to make. Of course it is also the case that the resources for rural development are insufficient. My fear, Mr Funke, is that when it comes to implementation the Member States will look primarily to their own interests. I very much fear that alongside these very welcome budgetary headings that we have agreed a number of other things will creep in which we most certainly do not want to encourage. The first thing that could creep in is that Member States will seek to use European money to solve their own problems. If that happens, the people will rightly say that we are just dishing out money.', 'The second thing we must carefully guard against is the consultancies and other intermediaries walking away with the funds made available to introduce these changes. I believe European‐level management and monitoring in this area to be one of the most important tasks for the future. We will have no credibility in the eyes of the people of Europe if on the one hand we say we want to exercise control over a number of problems and will make money available to do it, and then allow that money to disappear into the pockets of organisations and individuals who are not entitled to it.', 'This may be my last speech as although I am eligible for re‐election my party is not doing so well. My final appeal to the Commission is therefore to pay careful attention to this, and if I am not re‐elected I hope that I can read in the newspaper that you have received the message. If I am re‐elected, I will most certainly ensure that this happens.', 'Rosado Fernandes (UPE). – (PT) Mr President, I really must like farming and be used to the sacrifices it demands of us to come here at this hour to speak for just two minutes. But it is a great pleasure for me to do this, given that we are talking about an important measure, that is Agenda 2000, which deals with some extremely complex aspects of the European farming world. I do not know exactly what the European agricultural model is, nor does anyone else, but we intend to defend this model come what may, as it keeps farmers on the land and stops the countryside from becoming deserted.', \"In any case, the common agricultural policy will of course continue to represent an uneven playing field given that, as it is based on the idea of historical productivity, richer countries come off distinctly better than poorer countries, much as I dislike distinguishing between rich and poor countries. It is obvious that if some allowance were made for the difference between richer and poorer regions in Europe, the poorer ones would certainly not need so‐called ‘rural development', a rather vague and underfunded concept which we all know tends to mean that you only get out what you put in in the first place.\", \"The fact of the matter is that there will not be a budget for this ‘rural development', which would in practice be a way of re‐establishing the balance between the more‐ and less‐favoured regions. Even in the sectors where we are undeniably more competitive – such as wine‐making – there will not be any money for re‐establishing old vineyards.\", 'On the other hand, the European Union still considers wool to be a non‐agricultural product. It is to be hoped that with the promotion we have been promised for our products, and despite the limited funding we have been allocated, we can still be competitive in the war which is increasingly being waged at world level.', 'Novo (GUE/NGL). – (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial framework agreed in Berlin is a totally inadequate response to the requirements and objectives of cohesion, which should be the guiding star for the construction of Europe and its present and future ambitions.', 'So it is not surprising that despite earlier hopes that it would be maintained, the Cohesion Fund has emerged from Berlin with reduced resources, which will result in cuts for some cohesion countries, including my own, Portugal. Nor is it acceptable that, contrary to what Parliament approved in November 1998, the conditionality of the Cohesion Fund in relation to the stability pact is to be maintained, and that, for example, the Committee on Regional Policy should now be presenting an opinion in favour of the proposal for a regulation which envisages exactly this type of conditionality.', \"Without affecting the cheques distributed by the various countries, regulating the Structural Funds, especially by means of intermediate assessments of the efficiency reserve and by a general lowering of cofinancing levels, will in practice result in appropriations being ‘expenditure limits', whereas they were previously ‘expenditure targets'. There will certainly be a big difference between what was announced in Berlin and what will actually happen. And these are not positive points like maintaining the URBAN Community initiative, which in fact runs counter to opinion in Berlin. This could make a difference to the considerable doubt concerning the soundness and the efficiency of the regulation of the Structural Funds in future.\", 'One last point about the common agricultural policy and the reform agreed upon in Berlin, or rather the non‐reform. Berlin neither restored a balance to nor promoted a reversal of the present discrimination between types of production and farmers. A few one‐off increases in financing distributed between a few countries will do nothing to change internal imbalances, and may if anything accentuate them, even within apparently more favoured countries.', \"McKenna (V). – Mr President, I am speaking basically on the Arias Cañete report. We are going to vote against, as we did in committee. It is very important to stress that this is not because we do not agree with structural funds for fisheries. On the contrary. A fund is important to accomplish many necessary structural changes. But what we disagree with in this report is the way that it has emerged from the committee. Basically what Mr Arias Cañete wants to do is continue with the existing system which rejects changes and improvements proposed by the Commission. Two examples: last year the Court of Auditors examined in detail the funding for joint enterprises and made several critical comments. The Commission's proposal attempted to incorporate changes to improve the system. These were not taken up in the Arias Cañete report.\", \"The other thing is that the Commission does not want to fund the transfer of vessels to flags of convenience which flout international management regulations. But again this was not taken up by the committee or by the Arias Cañete report. As well as that we have two major problems with the Commission's proposal. The Commission has very little control over how money is spent and has publicly admitted as much. Too much is left up to the Member States. Not enough consideration has been given to criteria for granting aid. Vessels differ in their environmental and social impact and preference should be given to funding the withdrawal of damaging units and the creation of less destructive units.\", 'In committee we forwarded an amendment on transparency which was not accepted by the committee. Not only was it not accepted by the committee, but the rapporteur himself did not support it. This is unfortunate – plus the fact that the Rules of Procedure have left it impossible for us to submit this amendment again, which means that we cannot get a registered roll‐call vote on the fact that Members are failing to adhere to the whole issue of transparency. That is why we are voting against this report.', 'Martinez (NI). – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, this is the last major debate in this parliamentary term and it is an excellent debate on a highly symbolic issue: Agenda 2000, as discussed in Berlin, in fact, with the German Chancellor, the rediscovered Reichstag, the rediscovered eagle and even a war. Obviously this makes a change from the rather puerile debates we have sometimes had over the last five years, such as those concerning lesbians, footballers\" transfers or generic medicines. And Agenda 2000 raises important issues: the European agricultural strategy, the future of our food supplies, the structural policy and the financing of Europe, not to mention the opening up to the East.', 'On agriculture, Commissioner, we are still on line 92, the McSharry line, the Steichen line, the Blair House line. Prices are being reduced – 20\\u2009%, 15\\u2009%, 30\\u2009% – with a small compromise in Berlin, partial compensation and some illusions. There are illusions because by playing around on the world market and lowering prices, we will certainly never be able to catch up with Argentina, for example, in terms of the meat trade. And it is certainly dangerous to play around on the world market and overlap free trade areas. This is illustrated by what Mr Martin said earlier in relation to winegrowers, with Sweden and Ireland being designated winegrowing areas so that they can obtain concentrated musts and perhaps manufacture industrial wines.', 'And what good is an agreement in Berlin when in six months\" time the world trade negotiations will begin and, just as in 1992, we are starting to make concessions even before those negotiations have started? That raises the problem of our agricultural model. Mr Rosado Fernandes and many others spoke about it, just as you did, Commissioner. We talk about the European agricultural model. It is a model that stands for quality and welfare. It is a model that stands against the American model of intensive agriculture. Perhaps you have a third model, which I would call the Austrian agricultural model, because, alongside the Wagnerian American production, this would be light‐hearted farming, with farmers looking after the countryside, nature and the environment, so that Sissi could go for a country walk at the weekend. No doubt that is what you call the environmental section of the CAP. Farmers would manage the countryside and eventually be included under the regional funds.', 'That brings me to the Structural Funds. There, too, Berlin has hidden part of the truth. Apparently there are compromises. The Spanish wanted EUR 240 billion, the Dutch wanted EUR 193 billion and EUR 213 billion was agreed on. But in reality, the winners keep winning – Spain still gets the Christmas tree with EUR 9 billion and Great Britain still gets its cheque – while the losers keep losing. France has even lost out on Objective 1 and farmers are going to lose out on Objective 2 because they are now lumped in with the suburbs. Moreover, the Eastern European countries are soon to arrive and the planned funding is quite modest: EUR 3 billion a year for the pre‐accession period, which is clearly inadequate. So what will we do then? We will have to either share out the poverty between the farmers coming in and those who are already here, or we will have to create a new resource. And that is the third problem: funding.', 'We are aware of this problem. Germany does not want to pay more, and it is quite right. It loses EUR 11 billion every year. France loses between EUR 1 billion and EUR 4 billion. So unless expenditure is reduced there is only one solution: resources must be found. Because of your foolishness in terms of constantly reducing customs duties, particularly as regards the GSPs, they no longer amount to anything: they account for only 14\\u2009% of resources. The share of VAT is falling. We obviously still have the GNP resource, but that is not a federal resource, it is the traditional contribution to an international organisation, a state\"s contribution. Berlin clearly sought to increase the share of the GNP contribution. But that is not enough: by moving to 20, 21 or 25 Member States, and putting a ceiling of 1.27\\u2009% of GNP on the budget envelope, we will not even last a few years. We need other resources.', 'They cannot seriously come from the CO2 tax as Mr Ripa di Meana and the Greens believe, because nobody has ever seen carbon dioxide produce taxes, otherwise Pinatubo would probably be spitting euros. So there is only one resource left: a European income tax. And that is exactly where Berlin did not tell the truth. Just like the Europe of free trade, the Europe of the great single market lied; it did not tell us it was the Europe of 20 million unemployed and 50 million excluded. The ultra‐liberal Europe is lying now and it is not saying that in 2006 it will be the Europe of taxation and the Europe of a European income tax.', 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, that is why, on 14 June, we want to come back and we will come back to change Europe.', 'Karamanou (PSE). ‐ (EL) Mr President, following the charming address given by Mr Martinez, I fear my position will appear very banal. I in fact believe that, although it contains certain weaknesses, the agreement that was reached at Berlin on Agenda 2000 is a success that can be attributed to the German Presidency. The prophets of doom were proved wrong, and confirmation was given to both the priority that the European Union places on the policy of economic and social cohesion and the admirable and particularly effective cooperation between the main political Community institutions.', 'Coming, as I do, from a cohesion country, Greece, I want to express my satisfaction with the provisions laid down in the three major chapters of the agreement.', '‐ Firstly, as regards agriculture, I am satisfied with the preservation of the Community nature of agricultural policy, in spite of intense pressure to establish cofinancing measures.', '‐ Secondly, in respect of structural actions, I am satisfied with the preservation of increased per capita funding of the cohesion countries from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and also with the emphasis placed on combating unemployment.', '‐ Thirdly, with regard to the chapter on own resources, I am satisfied with the adoption of a more just system which favours less‐developed countries. My position, however, is that the system on own resources needs to be changed, which will inevitably lead to an increase in the Community budget so that needs can be met and the ambitious aims of the European Union can be fulfilled.', '‐ Finally, I would like to congratulate all those who contributed to this historic Berlin agreement, especially Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies for her tireless effort and my colleagues for the quality of their opinions.', 'Tillich (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, I shall now change the subject. I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I should like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Colom i Naval, because he has incorporated the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control in his report on the financial perspective and the interinstitutional agreement. I should like at the same time to refer to the most important, but also the most logical of these amendments. We have jointly agreed with the Council in the text that before the European Union\"s budget is adopted, an additional trialogue meeting will always be held at which the Council, the Commission and Parliament will agree on how possible additional requirements – last year there was the matter of aid for Russia – can be covered by the appropriations not utilised in the current financial year, or how new requirements in the next financial year should be dealt with and how full agreement can be reached on this before the budget is adopted.', 'I think that this procedure comes very close to what the Member States want, but also what Europe\"s citizens want, which is that a rigorous and efficient budget be adopted each year. I should also like to mention another amendment which the rapporteur has included, and which is connected with the discussion that took place on Monday evening in plenary: the 1996/97 discharge procedure. We now have a procedure whereby new regulations are very often adopted by the Council without the old regulation having been evaluated. We have made a suggestion in this regard, and the Council has been prepared at least up to now to accept that if possible, a new regulation should not be adopted by the Council before an evaluation of the old one has been completed. If this could be carried through, we would achieve a real success because it makes no sense to establish during the procedure for a new regulation that the old regulation was in fact not acceptable and the new one reveals the same shortcomings. I would therefore invite the Council to establish its position once more on this matter in detail, because Parliament has done so.', 'Ryynänen (ELDR). – (FI) Mr President, I would like to present the main points of two reports I produced on the subject of the applicant countries for the Committee on Regional Policy. When EU aid is being allocated and prioritised, it is important to pay particular attention to matters of the environment and health. In order for the single market to function, including, inter alia, a free trade policy in food, it is extremely important that applicant countries comply with the relevant health and hygiene regulations imposed by the EU. The EU cannot make compromises on these issues within the framework of a period of transition. Instead, some degree of flexibility is required when allocating EU aid.', 'In the Committee on Regional Policy we wish to stress the importance of three issues, in addition to that of flexibility. Firstly, we would like to emphasise the importance of cross‐border cooperation while preparations are being made for membership. This is especially important in developing networks linking government, businesses and organisations. Secondly, we would like to stress the importance of nuclear safety, and, for that reason, EU resources granted for purposes of nuclear safety must be concentrated within the context of PHARE. Thirdly, we want to stress the importance of training people to promote the structural changes that are now under way in the applicant countries.', 'All in all, prioritisation is important, but it has to be achieved through viable cooperation with the applicant countries. For that reason, the administration process must not be allowed to become too ponderous, especially when we consider how relatively meagre the resources are. I am also in favour of allowing the Commission a certain amount of licence in order to achieve maximum effectiveness in the area of aid.', 'Pérez Royo (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, I am going to speak on the Arias Cañete report on the structural policies for fisheries which is, of course, part of the Agenda 2000 debate. In our opinion, many aspects of Agenda 2000 are worthy of criticism and ought to be criticised, and some Members have done that this evening and in the course of the day.', 'But that does not apply to the fisheries policy. The outcome in terms of the rules for assistance in the fisheries sector can be considered satisfactory thanks to the attitude of the Committee on Fisheries which opposed the Commission\"s original plan from the start. It opposed this original plan because it destroyed the horizontal nature of the intervention measures and established a financing system charged to the EAGGF Guarantee Section, which made the planning of this intervention enormously difficult.', 'These aspects of the initial proposal were changed after Parliament voted against them a few months ago and the final proposal establishes a unitary instrument for intervention in the fisheries sector. Although there are still two regulations, there is only one fund, which means that structural intervention can be properly dealt with in the fisheries sector.', 'I have nearly finished, Mr President, but I do not want to end without mentioning an important fact: modernising the fishing fleet is certainly important, structural intervention is very important, but the future of fishing, for our fleet, depends largely on the existence of international agreements with third countries to provide fishing grounds for that fleet.', 'There are grounds for concern here, at least in some parts of the European Union. In my specific case, coming from Andalusia, I must point out that the Moroccan Government has just confirmed that it does not intend to extend the current agreement, which raises serious problems for tens of thousands of fishermen in my region, Andalusia, and also in Galicia. And although I know that this is not exactly what we are discussing today, I do not want to end without drawing attention to this very important problem.', 'McCartin (PPE). – Mr President, as a politician representing a very rural constituency highly dependent on agriculture, I want to say that the outcome of the Berlin Summit of Agenda 2000 was not as disappointing to myself or my constituency as we first thought. The Fischler proposals cast a great shadow over rural Europe to begin with, but at the end of the day we have to appreciate that the outcome, while not totally satisfactory, certainly is not disastrous by any means.', 'The fact that we are projecting to spend more money on rural Europe, together with the fact that the number of people involved in agriculture is decreasing, ensures that for the next seven years there is a minimum standard of living guaranteed to people involved in agriculture.', 'I hope it will be made clear to everybody at all times that the concessions expected from us in the World Trade Organisation negotiations have been made and that we will not offer the prospect of any more concessions to the farmers of Europe until the present seven years have expired. We have had the MacSharry reform, another tranche of it now. Farmers have been traumatised by the fall in their income so I hope that is the end of it.', 'I would like to say to Mr Fischler that while his message was not an easy one to sell he made a great effort to explain it to the farmers of Europe. His efforts are much appreciated, his efforts to educate and inform and bring public opinion along were commendable.', 'I was not as happy with the outcome of the issue of regional policy. We are winding down regional policy. The region to which I belong retained its Objective 1 status but nevertheless it is only really Objective 1 in transition, because the amount of money received under the new Objective 1 is actually much reduced from the amount per capita under the last programme. In any case we, too, appreciate the efforts that were made by the outgoing Commissioner. She worked extremely hard, not only in visiting the depressed areas of the Union, but particularly in relation to Northern Ireland and all the cross‐border schemes. Her presence was much appreciated and her total commitment to the whole issue of regional development is accepted.', 'Finally, there is only one person in the room tonight who will have a vote in my election: Commissioner Flynn will have the opportunity to vote for me. I should like to say we much appreciate all the hard work he has also done, and indeed all the Commissioners.', 'Pohjamo (ELDR). – (FI) Mr President, I represent the EU\"s north‐eastern periphery area, Northern Finland. I am currently examining the effects of the Agenda 2000 package on this region, which is one that is dependent on agriculture, although production conditions are much poorer than in the farming regions of Central Europe. The report on the Union\"s northern dimension states that the issue of the northern dimension must figure in all decision‐making connected with the Union\"s internal development, in accordance with the resolutions of the Vienna European Council. In addition, a decision was taken at the Luxembourg summit that the future of agriculture must be safeguarded everywhere in the EU area.', 'How did Agenda 2000 take these views into account? Through negotiation the EU\"s northernmost farming regions, which are also the world\"s northernmost farming regions, gained a few important concessions to compensate for the costs incurred because of natural problems. The grain drying premium and forage aid are the right tools: they should simply be on a more adequate scale.', 'Structural measures are important, but they are not enough in themselves to solve economic problems in the northern regions. The fields are covered in snow in April, whether they are thirty or two hundred hectares in size. It was still nearly ten degrees below zero in my home region just this morning.', 'The logic behind paying aid by the hectare is very hard to explain to farm workers in northern Finland. Why should those who reap the best harvests receive many times more in aid payments than those whose harvests are small because of the natural conditions? Hopefully, this trend will change, as Parliament has already agreed, and the differences in payments of aid by the hectare will be reduced.', 'Lage (PSE). – (PT) Mr President, as the French so wisely say, ‘tout est bien qui finit bien \". We are at the end of a long haul, and we have got here in pretty good shape. The results are not perfect, but despite the inadequate budgets and the faint‐ hearted reform of the common agricultural policy, and the continuing injustices and imbalances that it preserves, we have nevertheless avoided a serious crisis in the European Union and it is fair to say that over the next few years the European Union will forge ahead with confidence and stability.', 'This process has reached a satisfactory conclusion, and it has had a happy ending for the cohesion countries and for the poorer regions in which structural assistance is to be concentrated from now on. I cannot resist saying that it has come to a satisfactory conclusion for my country, which will receive structural support at an annual average level slightly higher than the annual average between 1994 and 1999. So Portugal and the other cohesion countries will be in a position to maintain their development and modernisation and converge with the European average, and this is actually happening, especially in my country.', 'For this reason, we welcome the financial perspectives, the interinstitutional agreement and the structural policies. We wish to congratulate the German Presidency on the work it has done in the face of the scepticism which has beset this presidency. And I can tell Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies – if I may paraphrase the words of a previous speaker – that if she were a candidate for election to the European Parliament in Portugal, the Portuguese would vote for her in droves.', 'President . – Mr Lage, I am bound to say that you have created a problem for us. If all the Members speak for twice as long as their given time, we shall be here until 4 a.m.', 'I can quite understand those colleagues who, unfortunately, have only been given one minute for their speech, but those are the economics of the debate.', 'I will stay because I have to, but the parliamentary services cannot stay here until 4 a.m. I would ask you not to exceed your allotted time. I understand – what can you say in one minute? But it is not my fault. Ask the political groups to give you a little more time. It is all going to come to a head this evening: 30 speakers with one minute each! How will I be able to stop them? I feel terrible about this. But on the other hand, if one minute turns into two, we shall be here until 3 a.m.', 'Fraga Estévez (PPE), chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. – (ES) Mr President, I would say that the great achievement of the Committee on Fisheries was that, when presented with the Agenda 2000 proposals a year ago, it very quickly recognised the serious errors in the proposals on fisheries structural policy and immediately drew up a strategy which was stoutly defended by all the draftsmen of the opinions and, of course, by Mr Arias Cañete, the rapporteur.', 'I should also mention that this strategy was agreed on in our committee after three public hearings with representatives of the fisheries sector and each and every one of the national fisheries departments. The result was the excellent report by Mr Arias Cañete, which has served as a basis for the negotiations with the Council. In my view, this report has led to an excellent compromise, which I welcome. Above all, I appreciate the fruitful collaboration that was displayed between Parliament and the Council. I include in my thanks all the staff who helped us reach a compromise that includes three of Parliament\"s principal objectives: a horizontal legal instrument, a single financial instrument, the FIFG, and a basic regulation finally covering all the financial structural measures.', 'I think this has been one of Parliament\"s major successes, but we cannot rest on our laurels because we still need to ensure the continuity of certain measures with regard to the implementing regulation, and this is dealt with in the second part of the Arias report. In my opinion, without that continuity, the fisheries structural policy loses much of its meaning. For instance, we need continuity of measures to maintain a modern, safe and competitive fleet or measures that have proved to be extremely effective instruments of fisheries policy, such as joint enterprises with third countries. These are drained of content by the Commission\"s proposal, when they could be an excellent formula for cooperation with third countries, as will surely be demonstrated in the future in the case of Morocco.', 'These demands are perfectly reflected in the report by Mr Arias Cañete, his final task for the European Parliament, and he leaves us with one of the finest and most comprehensive fisheries documents we have ever had the opportunity to consider. I therefore call on Parliament to vote in favour of this report.', 'Lindqvist (ELDR). – (SV) Mr President, coming as I do from northern Sweden, I should like to say a little about developments there. The situation is very serious up in the north of the country. Part of the problem is that activity in large segments of the state sector – and the private sector too – is either ceasing altogether, or being curtailed. In two thirds of Sweden\"s municipalities, the population has been on the decrease for several years now. And let us not forget that population densities were already very low beforehand, with three or four inhabitants per square kilometre. Many jobs in the interior are disappearing and local authority finances are extremely stretched. Regional policy is not proving very effective at all; in fact, it is rather ineffective.', 'As part of the package Sweden negotiated when joining the EU, Norrland\"s interior was granted special Objective 6 status. Objective 6 is now to be merged with Objective 1. Equally, Objective 5b – which covers rural and island areas – is to be absorbed into Objective 2. We hope that the new Objectives 1 and 2 will prove beneficial for the areas affected, so that the northern parts of Sweden – and of other EU countries – are spared still further depopulation and migration. There has been a call for Objectives 1 and 2 to be granted an adequate share of overall resources; we trust that there will be something positive in the package for the development of northern Sweden.', 'Malone (PSE). – Mr President, Ireland has the European Parliament to thank for ensuring extra funding for neighbourhoods in crisis. This decision is particularly important for Dublin. I cannot be repeated often enough: in an otherwise very successful city there are pockets of enormous deprivation. The URBAN initiative will allow for projects to be undertaken in these areas to tackle the ingrained problems of long‐term unemployment and urban decay.', 'The Council, including the Irish Government, actually failed to reinstate this project. But we in Parliament had it reinstated. We succeeded there. This proves again how relevant Parliament is to ordinary people.', 'This is my valedictory speech, Mr President. I want to thank you and all the Members and say what a pleasure it was to work here in this Parliament over the last five years. My colleague has spoken about the end; the end is nigh. I hope I will be back. We have a democracy in Ireland, a funny type of democracy: it decides who will be elected and who will not. We do not have a list system. Commissioner Flynn will appreciate that. I want to place on record my thanks to the outgoing Commission because in all the heated debates we have had nobody has stopped to thank those members of the Commission who have worked very hard for the people of Europe, the people we all here tried to represent. We have a very good line‐up of hard working Commissioners tonight.', 'Oostlander (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, when we see what stage we have reached in the enlargement process it is perfectly clear that the views of Parliament have had a great deal of influence. Political considerations have taken precedence over economic ones, including in the way we have formulated and implemented our strategy in regard to the applicant countries. We are delighted that pre‐accession aid has been principally focused on strengthening the administrative and institutional capacities of the relevant countries, including social dialogue, which is an important aspect of society in these countries. Democracy and states based on the rule of law form the basis of the European Union. They lie at its very heart and consist of much more than the acquis communautaire . There is a place for countries which seek to become based on the rule of law, but not for those that do not. This clear stance has been a major force for good. In Slovakia, Romania and the Baltic states it has been taken very seriously, even if it is not always easy to apply political criteria in practice. A good example of this is the position of the Russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia.', 'Decentralisation as an objective belongs among the political and administrative criteria and the EU must keep to this. I therefore welcome the fact that the reports have specifically referred to this point. Where possible management must be transferred to the governments of the applicant countries, which are already involved through cofinancing. It is good that the European Union is sticking with the PHARE priorities in all of this, making them its own strategy. Part of this is also the attempt to get the applicant countries involved in European political union, which is gaining a higher profile because of the emphasis on political criteria. There are great differences between the applicant countries, Mr President. This is why the guidelines and multiannual programmes must be drawn up for each country and for each sector. It is each country\"s own merits that count. However, it is not fair to constantly impose extra demands on applicants on the basis of our own national interests. I have in mind, for example, the resolution on the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, which is on the agenda this morning. Nuclear safety is important, but we cannot simply demand or pressurise countries to close down nuclear power stations as part of the accession process. The accession conditions cannot be used in order to settle bilateral scores.', 'Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, in two years of negotiation for seven years of European regional aid, of course there are areas where we would have wished to go further: clearer commitments, the partnership by local and regional authorities, even further guarantees that payments will be made on time to those delivering projects, a specific figure for social risk capital for the smaller voluntary organisations to benefit. Nevertheless, our intentions are clear. I want to underline two parliamentary achievements in particular.', 'First, not only have we ensured that urban poverty and neglect are dealt with directly for the first time, but against all expectations we have retained an urban community initiative too, which can target the small‐ and medium‐sized towns which currently receive less than 10\\u2009% of the funding.', 'Second, whilst retaining a 5\\u2009% eligible population for poor rural areas, we have also succeeded in redirecting some CAP support from within Heading 1, off‐farm, and Heading 2, rural development.', 'My own region, Essex, in the east of England, has 18 urban wards in the 25\\u2009% most deprived in the UK. In the Cambridgeshire Fens, which have been part of the £50m 5‐B Programme across East Anglia, but where 73\\u2009% of villages have no food shops, 74\\u2009% no daily bus service and not one a bank, these decisions offer hope. But for Europe as a whole, it ensures that the needs of severe pockets of poverty and deprivation can be tackled alongside help to large regions suffering industrial decline. It is an agreement which we can welcome.', 'Berend (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this debate represents the end of a long discussion and decision‐making process on the reform of regional and structural policy. Opinions may differ slightly on the individual points, but one aspect is clearly of overriding significance. The fact that we have kept to the timetable is an enormous advantage. It means that the review of the Structural Funds will be able to take effect in good time, in contrast to 1994, and that we will not be faced with a repeat of the dilemma we had five years ago.', 'My group has from the outset declared itself in favour of reforming structural and regional aid, so that the financial resources available are concentrated on the regions in greatest need of development, but also so that greater individual responsibility is assigned to the Member States, particularly where entire regions are not eligible for EU structural aid.', 'We welcome the fact that the new Objective 1 regions receive 70\\u2009% of resources. This means that it is now possible to target support at specific regions. However, we regret not having managed to introduce a separate objective for rural development which we have been openly in favour of the whole time. We also regret that with regard to the possibilities for national involvement, the Member States will not be allowed to select Objective 2 regions which do not meet the strict criteria, but will still be limited by criteria and the Commission\"s reserving the right to grant authorisation.', 'We have always urged that a regional GDP per capita of less than 75\\u2009% of the Community average be strictly applied as the criteria for the selection of future Objective 1 regions. This has been successful on the whole, even though in the meantime there has repeatedly been the danger of speaking out in favour of flexibility on this matter. Opinion is divided within my group as far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned. Some of my colleagues – particularly those from the southern European countries – support the Commission\"s and Council\"s proposal to continue with the Cohesion Fund in its present form. Others believe that for the countries which are taking part in monetary union, the Cohesion Fund has achieved its objective and has made a fundamental contribution to nominal convergence. There is therefore no reason for it to continue to exist in its present form.', 'Obviously, not all dreams can come true. Wishes still remain to be fulfilled. However, the compromise as a whole is a step in the right direction for the next planning period.', 'Elles (PPE). – Mr President, the last few weeks have been successful ones for the European Parliament in terms of our powers under the Amsterdam Treaty, the issue of discharge to have better control of Commission management and also, and not least, the vote on the Statute we took today to defer it to avoid some Council agreement being imposed on us. But what then of the financial perspectives?', 'There has been great progress and I would thank the German presidency for what it has done to add on to the financial perspectives vis‐à‐vis the Berlin Summit. We have made considerable progress, not least in classification and the way in which we can have conciliation across the whole of the budget. But for me, and many of my group, there remain some gaps in relation to the financial perspectives as they currently stand.', 'The first refers to the rigour – not in categories 1 and 2, but 3, 4 and 5 where there is ambiguity in some of the declarations, in some of the phraseology, which needs to be clarified.', 'Secondly, in terms of flexibility, we have indeed lined up for rigour in the financial perspective, but where we see that there is very little scope for flexibility, where some of it has been absorbed by URBAN initiative under category 2 and where we have no means of being able to use what parliamentary powers we would have under Article 203, then that means for me that a rigid corset has been set for financial discipline which is inappropriate for the years ahead.', 'Lastly, in this context, there is no general review clause of this financial perspective which is heading off for the next seven years with no fixed date for revision and so no possibility of this Parliament or the new Commission collectively reviewing it at a particular date, irrespective of enlargement.', 'Last, but not least, there is a problem which I notice has just arisen. It comes from our own President. Mr President I should be grateful if you would investigate this because our President seems to be paying more attention to influences outside this House than to parliamentary rights, claiming that the vote on the financial perspective should be a simple majority, rather than a qualified majority, though the chairman of the Committee on Budgets actually said it should be done by a qualified majority. I would appreciate it if this could be clarified tomorrow, otherwise there will be vigorous opposition in this House to what will be apparently imposed upon it by the President.', \"Lastly, may I say that in terms of Parliament itself, I believe that we risk being without better flexibility and having this – what I would call – bureaucrat's dream of being able to spend money without having effective parliamentary control over a long period of time. We should continue to negotiate and come to a good deal with the Council as soon as we can, probably in the early autumn, alongside the agreements on the Statute. That way we will make sure that parliamentary rights are properly preserved and yet have continuity as we should in the budgetary process.\", 'Izquierdo Rojo (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, this agreement means that the Spanish countryside will lose 100 000 million pesetas a year and there will be a reduction of 5\\u2009% in agricultural incomes. It damages the interests of small farmers, who will have to compete with large multinationals in a totally unfair situation. Income from herbaceous crops will fall by 40 000 million pesetas, of which 23 000 million pesetas will correspond to cereals.', 'Loyola de Palacio concealed the fact that the extra 550 000 tonnes for the milk quota does not attract a premium, and for bovine animals the increases will not make up for the agreed reduction of 20\\u2009% in prices, thereby producing a fall in incomes in this sector of some 30 000 million pesetas.', 'Mr President, this is a bad agreement for the Spanish countryside, for Spain and for Europe and we will therefore be voting against it.', 'Schröder (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, so as not to come under pressure of time, allow me to begin by doing something which I would not normally do until the end of my speech. That is to say, I should like to sincerely thank Mrs Wulf‐Mathies for her positive cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy.', 'By now everything has already been said at least once in the House on the subject which we are dealing with today. I would ask Mr Langen not to be tempted to heckle. However, one point has not been made, a point that in my opinion should be made, namely that we should rediscover the market economy if we want the people and the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to one day fulfil the criteria for EU membership. If we are really showing or want to show solidarity, then it is not sufficient to hand out money. I know what I am talking about, since I come from a part of Germany which receives a considerable amount of funds from the European Union and western Germany. However, this alone is not sufficient. The principle of the market economy must be embraced wholeheartedly. If we really want to show solidarity, we must help the people of Central and Eastern Europe to rediscover this instrument. However, this means that we in the European Union first of all have to begin to actually embrace the market economy again ourselves. I am sure that you will not mind if I do not quite use up all of my two minutes\" speaking time.', 'Schierhuber (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 has preoccupied us for months and in my opinion it required all those concerned to be deeply committed to it. I should therefore like to begin by sincerely thanking Parliament, the Commission and the Council for the work that they have done. Countless negotiating rounds had to be held in order to achieve an acceptable compromise. Parliament was actively involved throughout the entire process and was able to influence the discussion.', 'We have always declared our support for the further development of the common agricultural policy and of rural development policy. A radical course has been set for shaping the future European agricultural policy. This involves strengthening rural development policy as the second pillar of agricultural policy.', 'A series of important environmental measures can still be pursued by means of this. Environmental measures for farmers can be safeguarded in the long term, and hill farmers and farmers in disadvantaged regions can be given greater support. I welcome the fact that the individual Member States have the opportunity to take part in the decision making. Certainly, the lowering of intervention prices for beef and cereals could not have been avoided, but it is due among other things to the commitment of the European Parliament that these were not reduced on the scale originally proposed by the Commission.', 'I regret that agreement was not reached on the reforms in the milk sector. However, in terms of promoting disadvantaged regions, the decision to continue with the milk quota system, even beyond 2008, is of prime importance as far as I am concerned.', 'With regard to matters which apply across the board, I certainly cannot agree to a degressive model of direct payments. In principle, I should like to say that the compromise already worked out by the Commission, the Council and Parliament has produced satisfactory results as far as I can see. On no account, however, should the outcome be jeopardised by the final vote which Parliament has yet to hold. It is now up to the individual Member States to use their room for manoeuvre as nation states as far as possible, and there are a number of possibilities for examining national peculiarities. These should also be taken into account for the benefit of our farmers, thereby creating and securing more jobs in rural areas.', 'Europe\"s farmers and thus our European cultural landscape must not be sacrificed in favour of the world market; instead, we are demanding fair conditions for European agriculture, and this also applies to future WTO negotiations.', 'Gillis (PPE). – I should also like to add my thanks to the Commission, to the Commissioners present, and all the others who have worked so hard during the period I have been in this Parliament.', 'My group, the EPP group, can only note the result of the Berlin Summit and while it is a significant improvement on the original Commission proposal it falls far short of what is needed by producers.', 'The promise of full compensation for price cuts given in 1992 has not been honoured in Agenda 2000 decisions, and while farmers suffer much lower prices, the cost of the common agricultural policy continues to rise. More importantly, consumers continue to pay more and more for their food.', 'I fully realise the absolute requirement to make way for enlargement of the Union to the east and to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the forthcoming WTO round. However, it is not acceptable that so many farmers are given no alternative but to withdraw from farming because of the impossibility of making a reasonable income. Rural depopulation is rife, in spite of all the rural development measures. As I have repeatedly said, without the core business of farming most rural development projects cannot be successful, because they cannot stand alone.', 'I realise it is difficult for colleagues from other Member States to realise how low farm incomes have fallen in my country, Ireland, mainly due to the fact that Ireland is heavily dependent on export markets, both in the EU and in third countries. Ninety per cent of our total beef production and 80\\u2009% of our milk production is exported. The BSE crisis in the UK has almost ruined our export markets. As consumption falls sharply and other countries rely on their own production without importing, the collapse of the Russian economy has further weakened a fragile market.', 'The proposals on agricultural reform, while an improvement on the original Commission proposals, are not a long‐term solution. If we are serious about protecting the European model of agriculture, with all its constraints and additional costs, and if we are serious about maintaining the rural countryside we must return to prices which are in some way based on, or linked to, the cost of production. Do we want a vibrant, living, well‐maintained countryside or do we want a giant national park without people – and especially without young people? I believe that is where Agenda 2000 proposals will take us unless we make changes without delay.', 'Glase (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to depart from the subject of agriculture in order to discuss another important area with you, that of social policy. At Parliament\"s first reading on the European Social Fund, I recognised that the orientation of the programme will have a great effect on the objectives and regions in question. Nearly all the amendments we tabled have been included by the rapporteur. The ESF is still basically orientated towards labour market policies, and the PPE has placed special emphasis on this. Fund support only makes sense if the results of the projects are sustainable and they actually reach the target populations as well. The PPE agrees with the common position on the ESF.', 'We would like to see the new ESF swiftly and smoothly implemented within the next year, without further loss of time and guaranteeing prompt and reliable planning for those responsible for the projects and for the Member States. For this reason, we absolutely reject a third reading and will be voting against all the amendments which would result in this. As shadow rapporteur, I would be able to support the amendments which have arisen as a compromise from the negotiations within the Council if the Council and the Commission confirmed that the amendments in question would in fact be adopted and the danger of a third reading therefore did not arise.', 'The people of Europe expect us to support development in their regions, and to do so by means of speedy and practical measures which are not bureaucratic. We are placing a fund into the hands of the Member States in question, and they should not encumber or hinder it by laying down additional rules; instead, they can use it in a way which is genuinely in line with the objectives.', 'Langen (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, we keep changing the subject in this debate. It is not really appropriate, but I will now move on to the subject of the organisation of the market in wine. We have heard that there are certainly many things to find fault with in the part of the Agenda 2000 package that deals with agricultural policy. We must praise the Commission, the Council presidency, Mr Funke, and also Parliament for the progress made in one area; Mr Fischler, you took a long time to put forward such a good proposal, and you refused to withdraw the old one for a long time. Together we have managed to reform the organisation of the market in wine reasonably well, and I believe that after holding a debate like this one, we should not only voice criticism, but we should also give praise. It is sad that there is no wine here for those attending the last evening sitting of this parliamentary term. Mr Funke was certainly present when the former Federal Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced his watchword for the future wine‐growing policy on German National Wine Day: we must drink more. A quotation from the past!', 'However, I should like to get back to the point. We have pushed through Parliament\"s demands in this reform of the wine market, and I can only emphasise here once again that it would be a good thing if Parliament were able to take part in the decision‐making in the future, since we have mastered horse‐trading in this House just as well as the Council. What has come out of the organisation of the market in wine is in any case praiseworthy. Corrections have been made to the regulations on distillation and the rights for planting new vines. The Member States have greater individual responsibility. It is now possible to set up inter‐branch organisations throughout the whole of Europe. The reform includes programmes financed by the EU for restructuring, switching to different varieties, and modernisation of production techniques. The Council retains its powers. After all, we do not want to give the Commission too many powers, for instance over regulations on labelling and oenological practices. We must therefore preserve the traditional growing methods in Europe. Mr Fischler has also recognised and actively supported this. We are therefore satisfied with the reform, and I think that the broad agreement on the organisation of the market in wine has been a great achievement for Parliament.', 'Only those who know of the dispute that has taken place in the last five years within Parliament over the issue of the organisation of the market in wine are in a position to appreciate how much progress has been made. I should like to thank you all, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to drink to this outcome with a glass of wine in the next parliamentary term, if not this evening.', 'Otila (PPE). – (FI) Mr President, regional policy is central to the equitable development of the European Union. The Union\"s structural policy plays an important role in supplementing development at national level. Just as important as how much aid the Union can afford to give is the question of how aid is used. The Member States have the ultimate responsibility for acting wisely. Regional policy administered according to the principle of transparency will also boost the confidence of the public in the work of the Union and how achievable results can be.', 'EU structural policy resources must be targeted on investment in the creation of genuine jobs. The bottom line must be safeguarding employment and welfare in different parts of the continent. Regional development policy has to be all‐embracing, motivating, and it must promote enterprise.', 'The final decision on Agenda 2000 is a good European compromise. The fact that talks led to results in a situation in which the Commission had already resigned is proof of the viability of the Union. The Union can congratulate itself on the introduction of a package of reforms.', 'Costa Neves (PPE). – (PT) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, like all compromises, the one reached in Berlin has its good and bad sides. Let us leave aside the many positive aspects. As I believe that it is always possible to mitigate negative factors, let me highlight three of them. First, the reform of the common agricultural policy, which I regard as being a poor reflection of the concept of rural development, as in the end both the winners and the losers will be the same as before. Secondly, the reduction in public participation in private revenue‐generating projects, which, as it penalises companies, will also have an adverse effect on jobs. And thirdly, the concentration of funding under the next Community support framework in the earlier years, which, taken together with the normal flow of funds, will make accessing the Structural Funds a complex business, whilst funds that are not taken up will be lost.', 'In addition to these general factors, there is another which I consider to be of crucial importance, namely the absence of practical recognition for the ultra‐peripheral regions. After years of work to have them included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, it makes me very bitter to see that they have been ignored in Agenda 2000.', 'Peijs (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, you may well say that we are reforming the Structural Funds at the very last moment. For here we are at a quarter to eleven in the evening, with Parliament still in full session and even the Council still present, on which I congratulate you, Mr President‐in‐Office, as I have never before seen the Council remain in Parliament until a quarter to eleven in the evening.', 'We have now been busy for more than a year with the reform of the Structural Funds for the next term. It is now high time to give our final verdict, as otherwise the projects are not going to be able to start on time and I strongly oppose any postponement. I am therefore pleased to learn, as I did earlier today, that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a number of amendments to the European Social Fund which were threatening to lead to postponement.', 'In November I argued for the Community\"s URBAN initiative to be continued, as the small and medium‐sized towns which lie outside the objective areas, areas which are weak and ailing, also have their problems. I also argued for a new Community initiative designed to provide a flexible response to unexpected serious economic crises. In the Euroland era we need such a device, if you compare it to what you find in the United States.', 'Parliament supported both initiatives, but the Council wanted just three and we already had three. So there were two too many. However, the Treaty amendments from the Amsterdam summit made it compulsory to take clear account of Parliament\"s views and we fortunately reached a compromise. URBAN and RESTRUCT were combined to form the new URBAN. The European Regional Fund will in future help solve the economic and social problems of towns and neighbourhoods in a state of crisis with a view to promoting sustainable development. I am pleased about this, and it would be a welcome development if the Commission could now find a little more money somewhere to spend on this initiative. I have already heard details of the new allocation, Commissioner, and thank you for giving the innovative measures greater scope.', 'Mr President, perhaps I could make just one final comment to the Commissioner. As rapporteur for the 1997 Structural Funds discharge I should like to draw your attention to the fact that a country such as the Netherlands constantly comes out badly in the reports of the Court of Auditors, precisely because it adopts a more exact manner of reporting than all the other countries. Could you not take a look at these systems, so that this does not always come across so badly in the news coverage?', 'Fabra Vallés (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, for five years I have listened and learned in the Committee on Budgets that the only way to prepare a good budget and take advantage of all its possibilities is to conclude an interinstitutional agreement that guarantees the financial perspective for seven years.', 'Today we are listening to proposals to make us condemn the interinstitutional agreement, thus leaving us without a financial perspective.', 'Mr President, taking account of the latest negotiations and the flexibility accepted by the Council, I do not feel that the budget cut agreed on in Berlin justifies seriously endangering the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Unless there are final agreements between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, I am afraid that the only thing we are doing is promoting euroscepticism.', 'Langenhagen (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, the European fisheries sector is in a difficult situation, and this is largely taken into account in the future structural policy. I will concede this, Mr Funke, but the fishing industry is a relatively weak sector of the European economy and requires special treatment, especially as there are mostly no alternative forms of employment in the regions dependent on fishing. Even our original demand for a separate Objective 4 for rural development with separate treatment for the regions dependent on fishing did not gain acceptance.', 'From now on, therefore, the same measures will be funded by different sources in the different Objective 1, 2 and 5b regions, with Objective 1 regions clearly being in a better position. As a result, there is the threat of companies in the new Objective 2 regions moving into the Objective 1 regions solely because they will find better conditions and support there. Where I live in Cuxhaven‐Bremerhaven, there is the threat of just this kind of sword of Damocles; such distortion of competition must not be the result of European structural policy. Mr Funke, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, I think there are still some important things we need to do here.', 'I should like to finish by thanking all those who helped to ensure that we continue to have an independent Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament. For this reason I am looking forward to the new parliamentary term.', 'Günther (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President‐in‐Office, I should like to briefly refer to Mr Barón Crespo\"s report again and to point out that we are preparing ourselves for an enlargement which stands out due to the fact that we now have a number of countries requesting EU membership that we would not have thought possible ten years ago. In the past, dictatorships were always given preferential treatment in terms of accession to the European Union if they were able to make their governmental structure a democratic one and found a way of doing this. If this was the case in the past, then it should certainly remain so in the future.', 'Mr Hatzidakis pointed out in his speech that along with the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe we also have an island in the Mediterranean. He was talking about Cyprus, which is also thinking of joining the EU. I should like to include a further Mediterranean island in the discussion, namely Malta. Neither of these islands comes under the preparatory pre‐accession measures which apply to the other countries. However, like Cyprus, Malta is important geographically, and it has a stable democracy. It is true that both countries have been granted an extension of one year for the fourth financial protocol, but the structures are not in place for a pre‐accession phase. If we are thinking of a kind of mini PHARE, then I would urge the Commission at some point in the near future to demonstrate to the applicant countries the perspectives under which they can approach their pre‐accession phase, so that they obtain the same degree of specific planning criteria as the others, since those of us from the large EU Member States in particular should feel responsible for the small applicant countries.', 'Schiedermeier (PPE). – (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President‐in‐Office, we have been discussing and arguing about Agenda 2000 for a long time. We can now see the results of this. In my view the winners are: the Member States in the Cohesion Fund, in particular the three which we believe should in fact no longer have been eligible; the Objective 1 regions that receive an even greater amount of funds than has so far been the case in the urban areas covered by the new Objective 2, which still even receive funds from the Community initiative URBAN; and the applicant countries which I only hope will not become a market economy, as Mr Schröder said, but a social market economy.', '(Applaus)', 'The losers are definitely the rural areas and especially the regions bordering with third countries. When I look at the Commissioners sitting there at the front, it is clear to me why the regions bordering with third countries were not particularly taken into account. They do not come from these areas.', '(Heckling)', 'Three kilometres from the border regions, I have been told! Commissioner, the unemployment criterion, which we argued about for a long time, still accounts for 50\\u2009%. Soft criteria are only 50\\u2009%. The problem with this is that the number of unemployed might not be very high, but the infrastructure and the number of skilled jobs might not be adequate either, and young people who are well qualified then move away from the area or commute. This is not everything. Capping agricultural expenditure – Mr Fischler referred to this himself today – is obviously an important issue that has to be viewed as negative. This will naturally result in even less money being made available in rural areas in the future, particularly in the areas where it is urgently needed.', 'Commissioner, I have no wish to conceal how positive it is that we now have a safety net in the former Objective 5b regions, as well time‐limits for transitional periods – it was not certain we would have them – and that the Community initiatives, Interreg and Leader, are better provided for than before. We must be fair and admit this. I think that we will also benefit from EQUAL.', 'This is the last speech I will be making in the European Parliament. Thank you for your constructive cooperation. I should also like to sincerely thank those I have worked with and particularly the interpreters, who have no doubt had difficulty understanding my Bavarian dialect on occasion!', '(Applaus)', 'President . ‐ Mr Schiedermeier, you have put me in a difficult position. I was thinking about you and other Members whose regular presence in this Chamber was possibly coming full circle this evening, and we should give them the credit they deserve.', 'In any event, you have made the announcement and I think that the Chair must acknowledge your extremely regular presence in this Chamber and your entire activity here, as well as the activity of other Members who can claim the same share of the credit.', 'Cunha (PPE). – (PT) Mr President, I shall take ten seconds of my precious time to thank the Commissioners and the President for their stoicism in being with us at this hour of the night.', 'With regard to the financial perspectives, I feel that it is crucial for the European Parliament to approve the framework defined in Berlin. If not, we will be responsible for enormous confusion and instability in the management of Community policies and we could even distort the fundamental options under Agenda 2000.', 'With regard to the CAP, I must stress that the final agreement reached in Berlin was far better than the Brussels agreement. Nevertheless, the Berlin agreement was still a long way removed from the position adopted by the European Parliament. It failed to restore a proper balance to the CAP in terms of fairness and cohesion, and the less‐favoured and peripheral regions are still threatened by depopulation and desertification. It also failed to create practical conditions for applying the European farming model and to establish the prerequisites for the European Union to go on the offensive in the forthcoming WTO negotiations.', \"As far as Portugal is concerned, I deeply regret that some of my country's key specific problems were not taken into consideration. First, the effects of enlargement were not considered, although it is well known that the Portuguese economy is by far the most vulnerable to competition from our future partners. Second, the specific nature of Portuguese agriculture was not recognised, and the various kinds of production quotas were not extended, although Portugal is the country with the greatest deficit in the European Union, nor was any consideration given to increasing irrigation quotas, which would be invaluable given that in Portugal, which has the most backward agricultural sector in the European Union, irrigation has an essential part to play in modernising agriculture.\", 'Gallagher (UPE). – Mr President, I want to confine my remarks to the report by Mr Arias Cañete on structural measures in the fisheries sector. In devising structural measures in this sector for the new millennium the overriding objective should be to keep them as simple and as cohesive as possible, to ensure that they are flexible enough to respond to the specific regional needs of fisheries and areas dependent on fisheries or where there are significant fishing communities.', 'The original proposals of the Commission on structural measures were, to say the least, complex and in some places certainly could not be considered cohesive. For example, a proposal for the same measure to be financed from the FIFG for Objective 1 and 2 regions but from the EAGGF Guarantee Section for other regions could only encourage ‘fund chasing\", whereby fishing enterprises might relocate within the Community just simply to avail of funds for their particular project. If ever there was a recipe for regional dislocation and discrimination against traditional local industries likely to create unnecessary unemployment in the fishing sector, this was it.', 'Contradictions in the Commission proposals for the restructuring of the fleet which is subject to the rules of the MAGP, which require national programming, compared to Objective 2 regions, which are subject to regional programming, would only serve to confuse other matters. The less favourable redefinition of coastal areas in Objective 2 from areas depending on fishing and in Objective 1 which would eliminate areas distant from the coast requiring structural funds to support aquaculture and processing has to be resisted and changed, as this is clearly discriminatory.', \"I must welcome the Commission's decision to reverse its proposal to require fishermen to purchase an additional 30\\u2009% tonnage, which, if it had gone ahead, could only have been described as a penal law, designed to hinder the urgent need for modernisation and renewal of the fleet. The case to drop this proposal was forcibly pressed by Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and the unanimous view played no small part in reversing this decision.\", \"I wish to place on record my support for the Union's fishery sector to have a single cohesive structural policy. It is essential to guarantee that all regions with fishing communities continue to have improved access to fishery structural funds without any attempt to reduce the levels of funding or restrict or exclude access through increasing complexity.\", 'Nicholson (I‐EDN). – Mr President, there is no doubt that Agenda 2000 will bring tremendous change to the European Union, be it in agriculture or be it in regional policy. On regional policy I have to admit that I am extremely disappointed that Northern Ireland does not retain Objective I. But I want to pay tribute to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly for their support for me, and to the Council and Commission because I believe we have achieved a deal that we can live with and will be good for Northern Ireland in the long term. I am content with that. It is a compromise – a compromise that was a good one for my region. But I feel there is a real need to refocus, to relocate and reconsider and attain objectives that we have not been able to attain before: that is to ensure that we have not only got value for money but we also leave something positive behind where European money has been concerned.', 'On agriculture the proposals will not improve the position of my farmers. It is a very difficult position that agriculture faces at the moment, not only in my own region but right throughout the whole of Europe. Low income has been a tremendous problem. But we in Europe must defend the principle of the family farm and must not allow others in the rest of the world to import into our area food that does not meet our standards.', 'This is my last contribution in this Parliament, but I have every hope of returning to a future Parliament. I want to thank you, Mr President, the Parliament services and the Commissioners. I understand that on Friday I am going to have the great pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to Northern Ireland. I understand I am going to have the great pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies to Northern Ireland before the election period is over. I am sorry I am not going to be able to welcome Commissioner Fischler to Northern Ireland before the election is over, but if he wants to change his mind he would be very welcome.', 'It has been a great pleasure not only to be a Member of this Parliament, but over the past ten year I have found that Parliament has done tremendous work. And I say to you, Mr President, thank you very much indeed. While at times you get criticism – we all get criticism, so what! You have been a good President.', 'President . – Thank you Mr Nicholson for your kind words. We have arrived at the end of a marathon debate on Agenda 2000. More than 80 colleagues spoke, even if for a very short time. I had every sympathy. Although I tried to be a bit hard because of the lack of time, we are still half‐an‐hour behind schedule, which means that we are going to go well over midnight. I would like to thank all the participants, firstly the President‐in‐Office of the Council. A colleague remarked earlier that it is rather rare that a President‐in‐Office sits so late at night to listen exhaustedly to an exhaustive debate. Naturally the Commissioners have been more accustomed to sit with us until very late.', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 am.']}, {'topic': '11. Procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the report (A4‐0169/99) by Mrs Aglietta, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (COM(98)0380 – C4‐0501/98‐98/0219(CNS)).', 'I give the floor to Mr De Giovanni, chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, who is deputising for Mrs Aglietta.', 'De Giovanni (PSE), deputising for the rapporteur. – (IT) Mr President, as you mentioned, I am deputising for Mrs Aglietta who cannot be with us tonight, and the first thing I want to do in starting my report on comitology is thank Adelaide Aglietta and acknowledge the serious and important nature of her work. She has produced a very competent, subtle, acute and effective report, ably assisted by the entire secretariat of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, in particular Patrizia Prode, and with constant back‐up from Monica Frassoni. I wanted to mention that for one very simple reason: as we all know, comitology is hell. It seems like a technical problem but in reality it is a profoundly political problem, because then there is the problem of responsibility for monitoring implementation.', 'This has always been a very serious problem and the European Parliament has tended to be diffident about it, partly because it has not always been clear who is responsible or how the European Parliament could carry out any monitoring or get any information. It has to be said that the absence of a monitoring and information system has become increasingly less acceptable as codecision has progressed. In my opinion we must always bear in mind the close relationship between codecision and comitology and now, after Amsterdam, with the power of codecision extended, it is all the more necessary for implementation to be monitored closely and effectively. That is why the European Parliament has sometimes had to take a firm stand, even to the point of blocking the decision‐making process for financing committees from the Community budget.', 'I must point out, especially as I went along with Jean‐Louis Bourlanges, that it all had to do with the modus vivendi , and the modus vivendi is also an interesting point sometimes. It has helped us make progress, but actually it has rarely been applied, and then badly. What it has clearly demonstrated is that there is no way of resolving the comitology problem merely through more information, exchanges of letters, and documents from the Commission. They are important, but they are not enough! We are at a different stage now. We have before us a Commission decision and this report – hence its importance – sets out the opinion of the European Parliament after many months of negotiation with the Commission and with the Council. At the end of these negotiations we can feel partially satisfied, but I would say very partially, because there is still a great deal to be done.', 'So I want to clarify the European Parliament\"s real priorities, because I realise – and I want to stress this – that those priorities will have to be made increasingly clear, otherwise there will still be the risk of an interinstitutional conflict.', 'Parliament has four priorities. The first relates to information, and on this point the European Parliament has obtained a great deal, in fact almost everything it asked for. Of course, we will need to make sure this agreement in principle is satisfactorily transferred into the final text of the decision. We need to prevent any legislative act being adopted by the Commission and the committees assisting it outside the regular codecision procedure, and to guarantee the European Parliament the right to intervene within a limited time‐frame to challenge the legitimacy and content of an implementing measure, a point on which the negotiations produced partial satisfaction. And we need genuine simplification which goes further than merely abolishing the committee variants arising from the 1987 decision. Of course, I am referring, as everyone knows, to the great question of the regulatory committee, a question which remains open even after these initial negotiations. We are naturally hoping for greater satisfaction on this point in the future, because the European Parliament\"s attitude to the issue of monitoring is sure to become increasingly radical and clear‐cut.', 'Kreissl‐Dörfler (V), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to go into the complex issue of comitology again now, but I should like to inform you about the opinion I have helped to prepare as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights, which it has adopted. Our aim was to make sense of what is really a labyrinth of delegated powers and create something that in fact concerns all of us, namely transparency, clear separation of legislative and executive powers, and democratic control.', 'It is not at all my intention to dispute the fact that committees which stand by the side of the Commission are helpful in principle. However, I must make a serious point of criticism here. Community trade policy is one of the European Union\"s most important projects, but in this area Parliament is given hardly any opportunity for involvement in decision‐making.', 'During the present parliamentary term, we were not included once in codecision. The main committee active in this area, the 113 Committee, is completely outside our control. This is in fact not compatible with a genuine democratic institutional structure. There is therefore an urgent need for reform.', 'Our aim was also to prevent the powers from being slowly renationalised. Surely there can be no question of civil servants from the Member States evading decisions that have been taken a long time ago – for instance, PHARE, TACIS or MED – by having to give their approval once again for major funding projects within a regulatory committee, or by being able to set them aside. This gives them quasi‐legislative functions, and the regulatory committee as an institution should therefore be done away with altogether.', 'Finally, on the subject of information, we do not think much of the vagueness of the wording which states that the EP shall be kept informed on a regular basis. We need to have precise and full information, agendas, the composition of committees and calendars. In terms of keeping the general public informed, this should not be a problem in this day and age with e‐mail. I hope that the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights find sympathetic listeners within the Commission as well.', \"Corbett (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities. ‐ Mr President, all parliamentary systems delegate implementing measures to the executive. They do not immerse themselves in too much detail. But what is peculiar about the European Union's system is that during all those years when the Council alone acted as the legislative authority, it was willing to delegate implementing measures to the Commission only on condition that a committee of national civil servants would work with the Commission.\", 'We had three objections to such a system. Firstly, there were so many committees set up with so many different procedures with nobody quite sure who sat on which that there was a major problem of transparency.', \"Secondly, these committees set up by the Council or the Member States had the right to block an implementing measure from the Commission and refer them back, but Parliament had no such right. This was only possible for Council committees, not Parliament's.\", 'Thirdly, if a measure was blocked and referred back to the legislative authority, it was referred to Council alone, not Parliament and Council jointly, even though they jointly constitute the legislative authority. That we have found unacceptable.', 'With codecision, though, it is now Parliament and Council jointly and equally which will decide on what measures to confer upon the Commission and what procedures will be adopted. We will use that power, Mr President – and I warn the Council that we are determined to use that power – to ensure firstly that there is openness and transparency (and I welcome the progress that has been made in that respect in the Council working group), but secondly to ensure that there is equality between Parliament and Council. In other words, if Council committees have the right to block the Commission and refer a measure back then Parliament should also have that right. And if a measure is referred back to the legislative authority it should be referred to both branches of the legislative authority, not just to one branch.', 'There are some who claim that Parliament wishes to immerse itself in the detail of implementing measures. That is far from being the case: this is in the nature of a safeguard, the right to blow the whistle occasionally where you think that things may be going wrong. That is a right that exists in many national parliaments, ‐ not in all of them, national systems differ on this, but it is one that should apply at the European Union level.', \"If you look at the way we have used this power in the informal procedures that already exist, it is actually very unusual for parliaments to intervene and to blow the whistle. We have done it occasionally – infant formulae milk is a notable example. We blew the whistle, the Commission entered into a dialogue with us, changed its proposal and that was ultimately what was adopted. It worked. But it is very unusual. We do not want to do it very often, but we want the right to intervene when necessary. If we have that right then we will be much more willing to delegate more measures, knowing that we have that safeguard in place. But if we do not have that right, then we will be very reticent to adopt far‐going implementing provisions. We will want to hold it back in the legislative procedures. We will not want to delegate. I warn the Council that although it has made progress on transparency, if the working group continues to be so restrictive on Parliament's rights to intervene, then there will be no agreement and we will continue in legislative procedure after legislative procedure to block the comitology measures and resist the adoption of such restrictive measures and we will be very restrictive on voting the budgets and the credits to allow comitology‐type committees to continue to meet.\", 'We are not seeking to take powers to ourselves to intervene in the detail but we are seeking to have the safeguard. That safeguard is very important. It is the principle on which we will insist and unless agreement is reached in this matter I can tell Council that codecision procedure after codecision procedure will have to go all the way to conciliation and time after time there will be difficulty on this problem.', 'I invite Council to take the last few steps to reach an agreement with us on this.', 'Herman (PPE). – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of comitology is literally poisoning relations between Parliament and the Council. Indeed, it goes even further: it serves as a screen against public opinion, because the complexity of this comitology mechanism has succeeded in making the opaque fog around decision‐making even thicker in the eyes of the public. It is therefore a public service to clarify this obscure process and make it slightly more transparent.', 'When the European Parliament was granted the power of codecision, it might have been assumed that the two arms of the legislature were going to be treated equally. But this was far from the case. Was it treachery, bad faith, incompetence, negligence or ignorance? I have no idea and I am not going to guess. Article 145 of the Treaty on the delegation of implementing powers has still not been amended whereas lawyers generally consider that it should have been. Because it has not been amended, these powers remain with the Council alone, while it ought to be shared equally by the two arms of the legislature.', 'When the case came before the Court of Justice, it departed from its traditional integrationist case‐law – which lasted until the number of members increased beyond nine – and kept to a strictly formal interpretation of the texts, against all logic and against the fundamental principles of consistent legal interpretation. In fact, it is not normal for the body – a binary one, in this case – that decides on the law to be different from the one taking decisions on the delegation of its implementation. There is an error of logic in that situation which has only been possible because the lawyers were negligent when they drafted or amended the Treaties.', 'This matter could have been corrected in the Maastricht Treaty. It was not, and that is because, yet again, neither Parliament nor the Commission made much effort to clarify the situation. The Commission was extremely timid, not to say cowardly, about it. So now we are trying to repair this mistake through an institutional agreement.', 'We might have expected the Commission and the Council to acknowledge, finally, in this agreement that Parliament\"s claims were well‐founded. But this was far from the case. Concessions have been made, and there has been a little progress. It is a little less complex, a little more transparent, but that is about all. Of course, we are going to take what is on offer. We accept any progress, but at the same time we must express our dissatisfaction, and also our hope that next time the Treaty is amended, this error will not be repeated.', 'Langenhagen (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. – (DE) Mr President, it is after all three obligatory and two non‐obligatory committees which play a role within the framework of comitology and the Common Fisheries Policy. The committees have a vital role to play, for example, in the preparation of TACs and quotas, and in the implementation of the Multiannual Guidance Programme for the Community Fishing Fleet.', 'The relations between the Committee on Fisheries and the comitology committees just mentioned have two main aspects: firstly, the reception by the Committee on Fisheries of information on the activities of the committees and, secondly, the possibility for members of the Committee on Fisheries to participate in meetings of the relevant committees as observers. However, the information sent is insufficient and often arrives late. The current procedure for sending observers is also very unsatisfactory and is in fact even inappropriate. Unfortunately, any amendments proposed to date have been rejected.', 'Mrs Aglietta describes three objectives, or three good reasons why there should be a new comitology decision; these are simplification, democratisation and transparency. The Committee on Fisheries shares the view that improvements in these areas are urgent and absolutely necessary.', 'Kreissl‐Dörfler (V). – (DE) Mr President, forgive me for requesting to speak once again, but there has apparently been – or there may have been – a translation error. I do not want the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights to be abolished; I was referring to the regulatory committee. I think it is quite important to mention this, in case Mr Kinnock has been informed otherwise. Apparently, it was translated differently in Italian. So it is the regulatory committee that I should like to be abolished.', \"Kinnock, Neil, Commission. ‐ I am grateful for Mr Kreissl‐Dörfler's contribution. It was not so long ago that there were people in this House who wanted to abolish the Commission, so I am much relieved by his news.\", \"I begin by offering my warmest thanks to Mrs Aglietta, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in clarifying the so‐called comitology issue which, in terms of the procedures of the European Union really is rocket science. I admire, on a personal basis, the honourable Member's tenacity in pursuing this dossier over difficult months. I regret that other obligations prevent her from being with us in order to discuss her report tonight. We did, however, have a distinguished replacement, Mr De Giovanni, who showed his customary fluency and, above all, his very considerable technical insight when he described comitology as pure hell.\", 'Five years ago I thought comitology might be an inflammation of the bowel or a trapping of the sciatic nerve. Now I know much better and I share that in common with this House. It really has been an advance in my general knowledge.', 'The system, obviously, as has been said in the debate, facilitates an important link between the Commission and the representatives of the national authorities who sit on the committees and assist the Commission in its executive role. But as we have also heard, the number and complexity of both the functions and the types of committees raise concern about the transparency of the whole system. I am sometimes amused by popular descriptions of Parliament, and indeed of the Commission, as being institutions which clog the progress of the European Union. If only the general reporting press knew about comitology and the accumulating habits of Member States, it might bring them a revelation.', 'In addition, with the introduction into force of the Maastricht Treaty and the codecision procedure, this Parliament naturally and, in my view rightly, insisted that all implementing decisions should be subject to some form of control by the legislature. The resulting modus vivendi that was adopted in December 1994 went some way towards achieving that objective. But as we heard from Mr De Giovanni, it was clear even then that the issue had not been definitively resolved.', 'In June 1998, therefore, in accordance with the Declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal to revise the 1987 comitology decision and we did so with the aim of making the procedure less complex, less opaque and more open to Parliamentary control.', \"Honourable Members will, I know, be familiar with the major elements so I will not detain the House with a description. Suffice it to say that as a result of the discussions under the Austrian presidency and the German presidency which has made strong and commendable efforts to get an agreement in the Council before the end of June, and with significant parliamentary input in last September's resolution and now in the Aglietta report, we have reached a stage of negotiations which is likely, hopefully, to be conclusive. Naturally Parliament's requests have been at the centre of the discussion. I would like to make just a few responses to the more salient issues raised.\", \"As far as the right of scrutiny is concerned, Article 7(a) as proposed in Mrs Aglietta's amendment goes in the direction that the Commission wanted. It takes on full legal value and it makes a political dialogue with the Commission possible on the occasions when Parliament believes that a proposed measure would provide excessive implementing powers at the expense of the legislature, a point forcibly made by Mr Corbett. An interinstitutional agreement could subsequently be concluded to clarify how this provision would actually operate in practice.\", 'As for the informing of Parliament, the Commission is confident that the requests made in the report we are discussing for extensive transmission will be agreed in Council. In order to achieve that the Commission is willing to establish the most modern means of communication so that Parliament will be able to exercise its scrutiny continually and through up‐to‐date facilities.', 'We also agree with the idea of having greater clarity about the scope of executive measures set out in the basic legislation itself. In that context it is clear that for us, as in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, any adapting or updating of legal acts cannot entail modifications of essential elements of the original legal act.', \"Last, but not least, on the regulatory procedure, it is unfortunate, in our view, that the discussions within the Council have ruled out the Commission's proposal of a return to the legislature and often to the co‐legislators when the committee does not give a favourable opinion. However the current formulas devised by the negotiators would be acceptable to the Commission provided that there is no double safety net or contrefilet which would give the Council the means of rejecting a proposed executive measure. The reason for such a stipulation is very obvious. If there was some form of double safety net it would quickly become impenetrable and the Community would be prevented from taking any decision at all. In the interests of the Union, the Member States and indeed the institutions therefore, we think it essential to support the relevant amendments to the legislative solution submitted by Mrs Aglietta.\", 'We have now reached a significant point in the process of simplifying the system of comitology and making it more democratic. After thorough examination and many informal contacts at all levels Parliament should now be in a position to give its opinion on the proposal so that the Council can pursue its work with a crystal clear view of the wishes of this House. Naturally the Commission will continue to contribute actively to this work in the hope that by the end of the German Presidency we can reach an agreement that will satisfy all three institutions and consequently benefit the interests of the citizens of the Union whom we exist to serve and millions of whom are doubtlessly still awake tonight, awaiting the outcome of this debate.', 'President . – The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.']}, {'topic': '12. Fixed‐term contracts', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the report (A4‐0261/99) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the framework agreement on fixed‐term work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (COM(99)0203 – C4‐0220/99).', 'Jöns (PSE), rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have obtained codecision in social policy by means of the Amsterdam Treaty. However, whether or not we agree tomorrow to the social partners\" framework agreement on fixed‐term work comes down to exactly the same thing in the end. This will be the case more and more from now on, since the incorporation of the social protocol into the Amsterdam Treaty will mean that the social partners will always be consulted first. The ball will only be in our court again if they fail to achieve a result. Amsterdam does not even require us to deliver an opinion at any point during this procedure. The fact that we are now able to deliver an opinion is solely because the German Presidency insisted upon it.', 'The Commission only forwarded the draft directive to Parliament on Monday. We are therefore now seeing, barely one month before the European elections, that the Amsterdam Treaty in fact limits our rights quite considerably in the area of social policy. This does not make it any easier to explain in the European election campaign why it is so important for our citizens to vote in the June elections.', 'Surely it is unacceptable for European laws to be made in this area without the European Parliament having any kind of formal involvement in this. Not only did Amsterdam fail to remove the democratic deficit in social policy by including the social protocol in the Treaty virtually unchanged, but it even increased it. This kind of atavism needs to be eliminated at once. I therefore strongly urge the Council and the future Commission to conclude with us as soon as possible – by the next revision of the Treaty – an interinstitutional agreement which also does justice to Parliament\"s direct democratic legitimation.', 'That we are rejecting the current procedure does not however mean that we would therefore automatically be against all the outcomes of the social dialogue. I am merely thinking of our unanimous agreement in favour of parental leave. However, social partners\" agreements do not relieve us of the duty to examine them critically, as we did with the agreement on part‐time work. Allow me to come straight to the point: more and more people have fixed‐term employment contracts. In the European Union, the number of employees in fixed‐term employment has increased from 14 million to 17.5 million in the last three years alone. However, long‐term employment relationships are still regarded as the sole guiding principle for both social insurance and conditions of employment.', 'This in turn involves various forms of discrimination for fixed‐term employees, as we all know. The fact that the social partners have now agreed on a principle of non‐discrimination for fixed‐term employees is to be welcomed all the more. But unfortunately the same does not hold true for mandatory social security, although the social partners could have extended the non‐discrimination principle to this as well. This was already possible under Maastricht.', 'The only progress achieved on the highly controversial part‐time agreement is that the exceptions from the principle of non‐discrimination are cited more clearly. However, I absolutely cannot comprehend why the provisions combating abuse of fixed‐term contracts do not relate to the first contract, but only to successive contracts. What is more, the Member States can even choose from three options here. They either define objective reasons or a maximum duration, or the maximum number of extensions is defined.', 'This agreement does not set a single uniform minimum standard. The provisions, which are uniform for everyone, stipulate only that one of the three possible provisions must be chosen. In future, we must – and I think this is essential – make it perfectly clear once and for all what we understand by uniform minimum social standards, but I still urge you to agree to this agreement, because otherwise we will be left with nothing at all.', 'Hughes (PSE). – Mr President, Member States have committed themselves to the European employment strategy and to the four pillars of the employment guidelines, including the pillar on adaptability. They have also called upon the social partners to engage in negotiation with a view to reaching agreement at every level to promote adaptability by balancing flexibility for workplaces with security for workers.', 'The Commission has done the same in its Green Paper on a partnership for the future organisation of work and in its subsequent communication. The social partners are therefore to be congratulated for adding this new agreement on fixed‐term contracts to their earlier agreement on part‐time work and I hope they will soon pursue a fresh agreement on workers placed by temporary employment agencies.', 'But that, Commissioner, still leaves the difficulty of social security provisions for atypical workers, part of the original atypical work directive. It is clear that cannot be tackled by the social partners and it is something that the Commission is going to have to tackle urgently. It is an outstanding matter that we need to address very quickly.', 'Like any agreement under the social dialogue provisions of the social chapter this agreement illustrates a new facet of the democratic deficit, as the rapporteur has just explained. We, the Parliament, have no formal rule in relation to agreements like this. That also needs to be tackled urgently by Treaty amendments and in the meantime by interinstitutional agreement.', 'The final point I want to make is this Mr President: I am hearing rumours that one or more Member States might be interested in creating difficulties for this agreement in Council. I hope those rumours are not true, but if they are, I want those involved to think very carefully. Do they want to be responsible for killing social dialogue at European Union level and these important steps to promote adaptability? That would be the result.', 'I hope that rather than obstructing they will endorse this agreement as quickly as possible.', 'Pronk (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, I am pleased that we can still discuss the Jöns report today. I believe the rapporteur should be congratulated on having been able to get this item on the agenda at this final part‐session of the parliamentary term. I continue to believe that social dialogue is important and that we must also discuss the consequences of social dialogue. I do not believe the Commission has any cause for complaint. We wanted to discuss this at this final part‐session and the Commission simply followed the traditional line, and if this had not been the final part‐session it would have been on the agenda next month. So I do not believe the Commission has any reason to complain. I do not believe the Council played much of a role at all. If the Council had wanted to play a role, it should have adopted an interinstitutional agreement which would have put an end to the unacceptable situation that the European Parliament is not, formally speaking, sufficiently involved in the results of social dialogue.', 'There is also the matter of social security. I do not believe it is possible to ask the social partners to deal with the social security consequences of their agreement. The Council disagrees with this, which means that it takes just one Member State to insist on this position and nothing happens. But I should like to repeat my request for the Commission finally to draw up a directive in the field of social security, so that the Council can no longer take refuge behind the excuses it has been using to date and we will have genuine Council debate on a social security directive. I think these are the principal points.', 'Finally, we nevertheless find the rapporteur\"s report to be much too critical of the work of the social partners. It seems as if the Socialist Group actually lacks confidence in the social partners, while at the same time giving the appearance of having so much faith in them. That rankles, Mr President. We have seen it during this debate. The PPE has confidence in the social partners, is ready to let them take on the job, which is why we also want to accept this, we want to improve the procedure, but that is as far as it should go. We do not need to study everything agreed by the social partners in minute detail.', 'Ilivitzky (GUE/NGL). – (FI) Mr President, Mrs Jöns\" report, I believe, is a good one, since although she too urges the Council to approve the agreement negotiated by the social partners, she at the same time strongly criticises that agreement. The agreement is really nothing more than a very small and modest step towards improving the status of those engaged in atypical work. The new Commission should embark without delay on a programme of action to find a solution to these as yet unsolved problems. The most important is the issue of extending legislation to cover other forms of atypical work, such as homeworking and hired labour, which have become much more common of late. The other task to address is the guarantee of social insurance for all employees, irrespective of the form of their contract.', 'There are considerably more women than men with atypical contracts of employment. Thus discrimination against those undertaking atypical work is at the same time a form of gender discrimination on the labour market. Ending this should be a priority task for the Union.', 'Andersson (PSE). – (SV) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her report. I welcome this agreement between the social partners. The social dialogue has a significance of its own, leading as it does to agreements at European level between management and labour. This particular accord is the third of its kind and I would like to see more, covering such things as people working for temporary employment agencies and distance workers. A balance does need to be struck, however, between agreements as such and legislation, and I shall be coming back to this.', 'Agreements always involve compromise between the social partners. This one is no exception. Its two most important features are that contracts of an indefinite duration are the rule, and that those with fixed‐term contracts will not suffer discrimination. Social security is not covered, as the social partners did not see any scope for successful negotiation here. We have consequently urged the Commission to submit proposals in this equally important field. Let us hope that action will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.', 'This framework agreement is a sound one, in my opinion. If – as Mr Hughes says – some Member States are creating difficulties over legislative adoption in the Council, then that is extremely serious. We have here an important agreement between management and labour. Any blocking in the Council would be very damaging for the social dialogue.', 'Flynn, Commission. ‐ Mr President, I should first like to thank those who have contributed and particularly you, Mrs Jöns, for the speed of the response to the social partners agreement on fixed‐term work. The Commission only adopted the proposal for a directive last Wednesday. I know it is a short time span but it is a very important initiative both in principle and in effect.', 'For the third time the interprofessional social partners have concluded a major agreement at European level in the framework of the social dialogue process. The agreement applies the principle of non‐discrimination to fixed‐term workers and it also establishes a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed‐term employment contracts or relationships.', 'The Commission welcomes the agreement. It welcomes it as a significant advance in terms of non‐standard forms of employment and as the most comprehensive and refined agreement the social partners have produced so far.', 'At the request of the social partners the Commission has now adopted my proposal for a directive to make the provisions of the agreement binding in the Member States. By giving your opinion so quickly you will make it easy for the Council to proceed with adoption of the directive at the end of this month, in time for the Cologne Summit.', \"The agreement comes at an important point in the development of our shared agenda. Not only has the Amsterdam Treaty just entered into force but we are at a key point in the implementation of the Union's employment strategy. These events confer real opportunities and of course serious responsibilities, too, upon the European social partners. The confirmation which this agreement offers of their commitment and their capacity to contribute to laying down social rights is an important and welcome message. It is important because the agenda on working conditions and employment must now be one of the social partnership for the modernisation of work. It is important because we need to find a new balance of workplace flexibility and of course worker security, especially as new technologies, competition and the new demographic profile of the work force change the conditions for companies and for workers and indeed for public policy too.\", 'This social partnership requires a culture of adaptation and anticipation of change. That demands trust and cooperation on the basis of informed choice. That cannot happen without practical steps, like the proposal you have before you today.', 'Although the European Parliament has not been given a formal role in the procedures under which this directive will be adopted, I have worked closely with you up till now to make sure that the Council has the full benefits of your views and to ensure that Parliament has the broadest role possible within the limits of the Treaty. For me this has been a worthwhile effort. I want to thank you for the way in which you have continued to work on the agreement and the proposal for a directive in spite of the difficult timescale that has applied here.', 'When you think back to 1990 when we made the first proposal dealing with atypical work, there were three strands to that: nothing happened. The Council blocked everything, it was impossible to make any progress and here we have two collective agreements that have been achieved in the meantime. So I am satisfied that we are making progress here.', 'As regards the question about the interinstitutional agreement: I regard that as necessary. Documents have been prepared to advance that. Unfortunately it cannot be concluded just now but certainly it is an important matter that should be attended to as a high priority with the next Parliament and Commission.', 'I regard it as a good proposal and I would like to agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns. It has been requested, as you quite rightly said, by both the presidency and by the European Parliament as a matter of urgency. One has to thank Parliament for being so generous in allowing this to happen.', 'It is a good example, as Mr Hughes has said, of the social dialogue at work, in action, and we can look forward hopefully to a success in May. I hear rumours, too, but perhaps there is sufficient good will in the Council, recognising that the social dialogue is a fundamental matter and that this is a ‘deal done\", an agreement between the social partners. How could they turn their backs on it? I will be looking forward to that kind of good result in May.', 'President . – The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.']}, {'topic': '13. Protection of workers from the risks of explosive atmospheres', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4‐0155/99), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council (13836/4/98 – C4‐0003/99‐95/0235(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres (Rapporteur: Mr Pronk).', 'Pronk (PPE), rapporteur. – (NL) Mr President, this is the second reading of the common position on the health protection of workers who may be exposed to risks from explosive atmospheres. It is a second reading and what we have tried to do is look at the Council\"s common position compared to the Commission\"s original proposal, and compared to its development following the amendments brought by Parliament, although not by me as rapporteur, as I took this on somewhat later. On the basis of all this we concluded, again in cooperation with the European Commission, that we had to formulate a number of amendments. At that time we did not of course yet know that this would be one of the first reports in the social field to come under the codecision procedure.', 'Since 1 May, just a few days ago, when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, health and safety has come under the codecision procedure. I believe that this marks a significant new departure. It means that the Commission\"s role remains unchanged but becomes somewhat easier as it is no longer faced with the united front of the Member States saying that they want to go back to the common position agreed earlier. The Commission is then always faced with the problem of whether it should stand its ground and defend Parliament\"s amendments to the bitter end or bring the matter to a close.', 'All this has now been made easier. If there is no agreement the matter simply comes back to the European Parliament and then we must all discuss it and vote on it. I think that the Council in particular, which when it comes to social policy has not proved exactly progressive in its relations with Parliament, still has to get used to this. I look forward to being able to discuss this with the Council in the future.', 'Mr President, I have one question, which arose after we had completed the amendments. It concerns the position of LPG in the directive. I should like clarification from you on this point. Article 1 includes an exception, but there is a difference in interpretation between myself and your services on the one hand, and the English authorities on the other. The latter seem to give a different and somewhat broader interpretation. I should like to hear the last word from you on this point, so that the Minutes will be there to help the subsequent legislative process.', \"Hughes (PSE). – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Pronk for the work he has done, following Mr Mather, who dealt with it at first reading. On the second reading of this report he has been quite right to re‐present Parliament's amendments which were not accepted by the Council and also to include part of the Commission's text deleted by the Council. We in the Socialist Group will be supporting the amendments he has tabled.\", \"There are certain concerns about some of the amendments. I have seen a number of briefings, for example, about Amendment No 7. Mr Skinner will speak about this in a moment. I have read and reread the text several times and have also had contact with the Commission services. I cannot see how Amendment No 7 can be interpreted as meaning that all the equipment has to be replaced; adapted, yes, but that is a totally different prospect. Such adaptation seems very important to me for workers' health and safety.\", 'It is on that understanding of the meaning of the amendment that we will support Amendment No 7 as well as the others.', 'Perhaps it is just as well that this proposal will now be subject to codecision. Conciliation might give us an opportunity to reach some understanding on these matters with the Council.', 'In closing what will be my final speech in this Chamber for this mandate as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would like to thank all of the Members of this House for their cooperation in moving forward the number of dossiers we have in this area of work in the last five years; and you too, Commissioner, for your valued cooperation. The progress that has been made will stand as a testament to your commitment to European employment and social policy.', 'Skinner (PSE). – Mr President, I should like to add my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, whom we have seen on many an occasion take on the mantle of health and safety, to you, Commissioner, and your services for expediting much of the legislation which has been necessary in this field, and for your assistance both formally and informally in helping Parliament to understand what can and cannot be done.', 'Indeed now, as Mr Hughes has just said, we move into the difficult area of codecision which can help us. In this particular directive we can seek further clarification from the Council. Mr Pronk and I have managed to find a compromise on Amendment No 2, which has led to a better text. I look forward to the Commission and the Council accepting that text. But Amendment No 7, where disagreement lies, certainly requires a large amount of clarification. Until we get that it is not one that I am going to be fond of supporting.', 'However, codecision is going to be about sensible discussion. I hope the Council will respond to what Parliament votes tomorrow. I too would like to say that I have enjoyed working in health and safety. I spent some time working on a lot of these reports. I must commend Mr Hughes, the chairman of the committee. The intensity of this discussion on health and safety has been led through that chair. I wish him the very best and hope that maybe, when we both come back in July, we will continue some of that particular discussion. Nonetheless I would like to hear from the Commission as to what we can do about Amendment No 7.', 'Flynn, Commission. ‐ Mr President, let me first of all thank you, Mr Pronk. You have done a remarkably good job on what is regarded as a very technical matter.', \"The Commission is prepared to accept all of the proposed amendments. The Commission considers in fact the Council's common position as a step forward towards achieving better protection for the health and safety of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres where fatal accidents occur every day. Nevertheless, you know that the Commission has maintained some reserves as regards the common position, for example on appropriate supervision and on the deletion of items in Annex 2 covering additional risks resulting from power failure and the need to provide for manual override where automatic processes deviate from intended operating conditions and the need to be able quickly to dissipate or isolate accumulated energy in the event of an emergency shutdown.\", 'The text of the common position in these areas is considered by the Commission to be weaker than the amended proposal. The Commission therefore considers that the amendments proposed by the European Parliament are essential for the establishment of a strong, coherent prevention strategy against the risks arising from explosive atmospheres.', \"As regards the amendments on the establishment of the vademecum and on the requirements for provision of information to undertakings, particularly SMEs. I share your view that a simple statement in the Council's minutes is not a sufficient guarantee of follow‐up.\", \"Finally, the rapporteur's approach to bringing the proposed safety sign into line with the international CEN ISO standard is a good approach. As far as LPG is concerned, of course, the situation is that road traffic regulations cover the question of, say, tankers of LPG being delivered to a filling station. LPG in a plant is covered, but in a filling station the end user, a car, for instance, is not covered under Article 118a or 137. I would like to say as well that we have no difficulty with Amendment No 7 as it is our understanding as well that equipment is to be adapted, not replaced. That is an understanding I can give to the House.\", 'If I may, Mr President, this is probably our last meeting together on some very important broad issues that deal with working people. I would like to finish by recording my personal pleasure and satisfaction with what we have achieved together on the development of employment policy and social policy agenda for the European Union. I would like to record my appreciation for the important contribution that you have made to achieving our shared objectives. When the history of the development of social policy and employment policy comes to be written subsequent to my leaving the Commission, the period 1993‐1999 will be recorded as quite a remarkable period for change, for advanced thinking and for Treaty change support. For those of you who will not be returning I want to congratulate you on the contribution you have made to social policy advances over these last few years. They are quite significant and they will make a real difference to European citizens. For those who will be back in July your responsibility to build on this base that we have started together will be quite immense. I believe it will be made easier because of the work and the cooperation that we have had these last few years.', 'I want to say to you, Stephen Hughes, as the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it has been my personal pleasure to work with you, not just as a good parliamentarian, but as a gentleman of credibility and integrity. You deserve your place in this House and I know that you will be back with your friends here to continue the good work. It has been a personal pleasure for me these years and I have gained enormously from the experience. I am full of expectation for the good things that will be achieved in the coming years for the citizens of Europe. It has been my pleasure to have been part of that advance.', '(Applaus)', 'President . – I must say that it may not be very original but still, it does provoke emotion. It appears that this is an evening when we are reminded of Shakespeare who urged us to ‘bring garlands\". We are distributing garlands tonight. But it is justified after years of hard work. It has been difficult sometimes but we have also had satisfying cooperation. On the part of the presidency of Parliament I must thank Commissioner Flynn for having been very pleasant here – sometimes a bit long in his explanations, but otherwise trying hard.', 'Pronk (PPE). – Mr President, I am very glad that the Commissioner has accepted all seven amendments. Seven is a holy number which expresses a certain fullness and that is very good. I would like to thank you for all the cooperation with our group, Parliament, and Mr Hughes, who has been an excellent chairman in this connection. You have been a ‘stayer\". In skating terms that is someone who may start a bit slowly but goes on and achieves an awful lot in the end. That is what it is all about in politics. I thank you very much for that. We have achieved a lot on social policy. We can now go to the electorate with those results, partly or indeed mainly thanks to you.', 'Flynn, Commission. – There is a little plaque hanging in my office. It is a quotation from Abraham Lincoln, who was President of the United States from 1861 to 1865. It has been my political motto all my life. As I leave you I would like to quote it for you: ‘I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I intend to do it till the very end. If in the end I am proved right then all the things that people have written against me will count for nothing. If in the end I am proved wrong then angels swearing that I was right all the time will do me no good.\"', 'President . – I am sorry to depart from this rather poetic atmosphere but we still have some work to do.', 'The debate is closed.', 'The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 am.']}, {'topic': '14. EC‐Mexico Partnership Agreement', 'paragraphs': ['President . – The next item is the recommendation (A4‐0220/99) by Mrs Miranda de Lage, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part (COM(97)527‐11618/97 + 11620/97 + COR 1 – C4‐0023/98‐97/0289(AVC)).', 'Miranda de Lage (PSE), rapporteur. – (ES) Mr President, Mr Vice‐President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the debate I am opening on the now famous global agreement with Mexico ends a five‐year cycle during which Parliament has worked actively with the European Commission to renew and strengthen relations with the Latin American countries, including Mexico.', 'The Commission\"s communication on Mexico provided the opportunity for us to draw up a first report in 1995. The conclusions reflected Parliament\"s priorities and, as a sine qua non for adopting a future agreement with that country, the conditionality or human rights clause, political dialogue and parliamentary dialogue were priorities, as well as regional development, social development, assistance to women at risk and a long list of other points. Of course, in addition to the objective of liberalising trade, we also wanted the agreement to include guarantees for environmental protection and respect for the basic labour standards of the International Labour Organisation.', 'Parliament\"s demands have been adequately reflected in the articles. The agreement includes the trade objectives of the interim agreement, but also incorporates a social philosophy, a range of possibilities for cooperation in areas such as professional training, regional development or support for cultural diversity.', 'Recital 7 relates to the social and environmental issues. I am highlighting this because I want to express my appreciation for the constructive position of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions on this agreement. As a result, I would suggest that we look for some formula which makes it possible to incorporate recital 7 into the bilateral political dialogue, giving a clear signal that any requirements, including the basic standards of the ILO, commit the 15 Member States and Mexico equally, and not just Mexico alone.', 'A calm and impartial analysis of the text leads to the conclusion that Parliament\"s influence has been considerable. But I must point out that this influence was possible thanks to the excellent attitude of the Commission, and I am grateful for its collaboration throughout this process.', 'In other respects, everything is not rosy, and I have to come down hard on the Mexican Government. It should take careful note that the Committee on External Economic Relations categorically rejects the tariff increase announced by Mexico on 1 January this year. That decision was inappropriate and arbitrary as well as being discriminatory because it does not apply erga omnes . I must adamantly insist that this measure be abolished as soon as possible. The decision is unfortunate because it accelerates the increasingly evident deterioration in trade flows. These have been affected for five years by the dynamism of NAFTA, and thus our share of the Mexican market has fallen from 11\\u2009% to a modest 6\\u2009% over that period. The Committee on External Economic Relations had already drawn attention to this deterioration in Mr De Vries\"s report in 1990. NAFTA\"s arrival has had negative consequences on our interests and I must stress that point.', 'Approval of the report we are debating will strengthen our political position and allow us to use this instrument to follow up the negotiations on political, social and economic issues, including, most particularly, the paragraph on democracy and human rights. We need to talk about those issues. The legal provisions to improve them and defend them have substantially increased in Mexico, and it is only fair to recognise that.', 'The opinions by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation stress the need to broaden and improve the conditions for development. The Committee on External Economic Relations shares this view and emphasises it in a paragraph in this report. We are offering faithful cooperation and we also support the search for a permanent solution to the Chiapas conflict.', 'Mexico is a developed, dynamic country, and a member of the OECD, playing an increasingly active role in relations within North and South America and with Europe. Our association with Mexico is more than a market, and more than a facility for getting access to NAFTA. It is a political commitment of profound significance. The adoption of this recommendation will send a good signal to the Americas at a time when doubts are growing about our will to increase European efforts in the region.', 'The Union faces a number of challenges: its peace obligations and commitments and the dilemma of enlargement. Now is the time to send a positive signal to the upcoming first summit of Heads of State and Government, that is, the 15 plus 33. The philosophy of this agreement includes important development policies. Like any compromise, it may be unsatisfactory in some areas, but nobody can deny that it opens the door to wide and meaningful possibilities for collaboration. And nobody can deny that, precisely because of its content, it has generated a considerable level of debate.', 'Mr President, this may be my last speech in this Parliament, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Marín very sincerely for the hard work he has done on cooperation with Latin America. I also want to thank everyone who has cooperated in this endeavour throughout the years and – obviously – all the members of the secretariat of the Committee on External Economic Relations who have worked towards these objectives, as well as all those who have believed in the advantages of cooperation with Latin America. Finally, in view of the late hour, I would also like to thank the interpreters for their patience.', 'Salafranca Sánchez‐Neyra (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. – (ES) Mr President, my group recommends that we give our assent to the global agreement with Mexico for four fundamental reasons, and two of them are based on the pure logic of democracy.', 'Firstly, all the parliamentary committees involved, the Committee on External Economic Relations, the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, have clearly requested it.', 'Secondly, the main political forces and the leading political groups in Mexico have also requested it, and it has been called for and approved by all the Member States of the European Union.', 'In my view, it is not legitimate that the course of the interim agreement, to which Parliament gave its assent at the time, should be confused with and affected by the course of the global agreement', 'And finally, I feel that it is perfectly true that when defending human rights – which certainly leave much to be desired in Mexico – it is much better to defend them with an agreement which includes a clause on democracy – as this global agreement does – than with the existing agreement which does not contain such a clause.', 'I would like to take advantage of this debate to make two points which I consider important. First, I want to reiterate Mrs Miranda de Lage\"s comment that the Mexican Government must promise to withdraw the unilateral increase in tariffs before the end of this financial year. Secondly, the European Commission must undertake to keep Parliament informed on the outcome of the trade negotiations before they are concluded.', 'Finally, Mr President, for all the reasons I have mentioned, my group urges the European Parliament to give its assent as decisively and firmly as we condemned the human rights violations that had occurred in that country at a stage.', 'Valdivielso de Cué (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. – (ES) Mr President, at this stage it is difficult to find anything new to say, especially with regard to Mrs Miranda de Lage\"s report, which could not be more complete, and given what my colleague Ignacio Salafranca has just added.', 'In actual fact, there are many reasons to start saying that Mexico does not have the proper reference point, the proper democratic credentials, and so on. But I think Mexico, democracy and the agreement with the European Union will be best served by giving our assent. Insisting on perfection often means that all we do is stand in the way of progress. And there is so much that is positive about this agreement, so in this case the best thing we can do is support it. We know that Mexico has a democratic deficit, but the best thing we can do to help Mexico establish a democratic structure is approve this agreement with the European Union.', 'I would also like to highlight some points within the agreement which, as I understand it, are rather original, such as the inclusion of the democracy clause as an essential element of the agreement. This will promote respect for human rights in this Latin American country and it will produce better results in this field than possibly delaying the vote, which would make political and social cooperation difficult.', 'As has already been mentioned, we also hope that the new agreement will serve to revitalise trade between both partners – the European Union and Mexico. Only 9\\u2009% of all Mexican exports to the European Union are agricultural and there is considerable complementarity in the trade flow. This should facilitate the rapid negotiation and entry into force of this agreement.', 'In short, I want to reiterate what the previous speakers have said and I feel that this agreement is extremely positive for Mexico, the European Union and, as a result, the progress of democracy in the Western world.', 'Newens (PSE). – Mr President, I wish to speak in favour of the Mexico partnership agreement and to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and thank Mr Marín for his contribution. I most certainly am not a supporter of neo‐liberal policies but the removal of trade barriers is a fact of life and the coming into force of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement has increased Mexican dependence on trade with the United States of America. The EU‐Mexico agreement is therefore urgently needed to help restore the balance and to foster political and cultural, as well as economic, links between Mexico and Europe in the interests of both sides.', 'I have long been deeply critical of human rights abuses in Mexico and have been associated with urgency motions passed by this Parliament and other manifestations of our profound concern. I believe, however, that the conclusion of this agreement will facilitate the continuing dialogue on these issues which will give the European Parliament far more leverage than if the agreement did not go ahead. I am, however, most deeply anxious that the Commission should monitor the situation and we should not hesitate to speak out. I am disturbed that there is concern in Mexico that full information has not been provided, that civil society is being excluded and that multinationals and private capital interests have carried too much sway. These are matters on which Mexican representatives have every right to raise their voices and I, for one, would hope that they would meet with a sympathetic response in Europe. However, the postponement of the decision on this accord at this point at the end of this Parliament would not, in my view, be in the long‐term interest of the Mexicans or of Europeans. Many of us have fought hard to build links and create solidarity between Europe and Latin America as a whole and the casual postponement of this accord could be very damaging.', 'I believe that we should all vote for this agreement to go ahead because, among other things, it will help to achieve a better human rights and democratic rights record in Mexico over the course of future years.', 'González Álvarez (GUE/NGL). – (ES) Mr President, I think the first thing that needs to be said, because it is the general feeling in Parliament today, is that we are all in agreement – I do not think there is anyone who is not – that we must strengthen our commercial and political relations with Mexico and with Latin America in general. It is a pity that Mexico\"s trade with the United States is increasing so much, under a trade agreement which does not actually contain a democracy clause or other clauses that are included in this one, and that its trade with Europe is decreasing.', 'Having made it clear that we do want an agreement with Mexico, we cannot ignore the many questions raised by quite a number of significant non‐governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International League for Human Rights and Intermón . In other words, many groups have expressed their concern to us and we share their concerns. First, the negotiations are not over yet. Secondly, there has been a lack of transparency, a lack of participation and a lack of information. And lastly, there is no mechanism for monitoring the environmental and social clauses or the democracy clause. There is no clear monitoring mechanism.', 'I want to end by saying that we are a pluralist group and we will perhaps be voting in different ways. I proposed abstention, active abstention, and my good friend Ludivina García Arias, who has a great affection for Mexico, asked me what active abstention meant. Mr President, active abstention means no more and no less than that we are not washing our hands of the agreement with Mexico, that we want an agreement, but we want a good one. That is why we are suggesting active abstention, and we are going to work for an agreement which, in the end, will satisfy both Mexicans and Europeans.', 'Kreissl‐Dörfler (V). – (DE) Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty has been in force for just a few days. It finally gives the European Parliament more rights with which to carry out one of the most important duties of a parliament, namely involvement in decision‐making and controlling the other institutions. It was precisely this which justified our decision a year ago to agree to just the Interim Agreement with Mexico, and to give our assent to the Global Agreement only once negotiations on all parts of the Treaty had come to a close.', 'We did not want to give the Commission carte blanche . Incidentally, these were the words used by our rapporteur, Mrs Miranda de Lage, to justify the decision. The Mexican Parliament also only approved the agreement on the condition that it will be consulted again once the negotiations have come to a close. It is therefore not fair to claim that the Mexicans accepted the agreement a long time ago. There has been no change in the situation since. There has been no new Commission paper on which we could make a decision.', 'The negotiations will last for a long time yet, and civil society in Mexico is extremely dissatisfied with this. Various parties, such as the PRD, which has also written to us, and the Greens in the Mexican Parliament do not agree with the way the negotiations are taking place. They insist on the need for a fundamental change in direction and strongly urge us not to give our assent yet. In my view, it would therefore be completely irresponsible towards European citizens, but also towards our Mexican partners, to hand over control now.', 'Why are we agreeing now to something that does not yet exist in its entirety? It makes no difference whatsoever for the Commission to be able to continue negotiations. But I am standing up for the rights of a parliament to take a vote on something which must in principle exist as a whole. How could we justify to the public the fact that we are campaigning for more rights for Parliament, although we are saying that we do not want to make any decisions, and instead want simply to give carte blanche ? It is precisely this which I do not understand.', 'I must say one more thing on this matter; it is after all the last round of speeches this evening. Obviously I am in favour of an agreement with Mexico, and this applies to the entire Green Group. I hold my colleague, Mrs Miranda de Lage, in high esteem and I also have the highest regard for her work. However, this problem of how a parliament makes a decision is of fundamental importance for me. It is just about this and nothing else.', 'Marín, Commission. – (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement submitted today for ratification by Parliament represents an essential stage in the ambitious voyage we set out on four years ago to establish a new relationship with Mexico that would fulfill our hopes.', 'The revitalised situation in Mexico led Europe to seek a framework of strategic relationships with that country based on reciprocity and partnership and built on mutual interests. We were motivated by the importance of helping to build an international community based on democratic principles, the rule of law and full respect for human rights. We were also motivated by the importance of reaffirming, within the international debate, that it is possible to conclude bilateral trade agreements that are compatible with the World Trade Organisation. Finally, we were motivated by the importance of giving a boost to our economies, thus promoting the growth of world trade, and by the importance of consolidating our respective presence in interdependent geographical areas.', 'That is how Parliament saw it back in 1995, when Mrs Miranda\"s report provided the political impetus needed to move towards more ambitious objectives. And that is how Parliament saw it in May 1998, when it gave its assent to the interim agreement. And I would like to take this opportunity – as I have mentioned Mrs Miranda – to thank her and her predecessor, Mr Newens, for their hard work, together with others who have been involved in this area and participated in the process, such as Mr Salafranca, Mrs González Álvarez and, in general, even those who have always been critical or have opted for a much more critical approach to our relations with Latin America as a whole.', 'Today you have before you the global agreement that establishes the legal framework for our future long‐term relationship. Like the interim agreement, this new agreement puts special emphasis on what has been one of the main demands of the European Parliament, to which the Commission and the Council have given maximum priority: the clause on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, an essential element and foundation of this relationship.', 'There are three main elements to the agreement. The first is to institutionalise political dialogue at the highest level. The second is to extend and deepen our cooperation, and here, for the first time, there is explicit provision for cooperation on human rights and democracy, and important areas such as social development, the fight against poverty, environmental protection and consumer protection are included. I can confirm what most of you have said: if we want to make progress on the issues I have just mentioned, political dialogue makes much better progress with an agreement than without an agreement.', 'And finally, the third element, the economic element, is very important too, establishing a free trade area between the European Union and Mexico covering both goods and services.', 'Now let me tell you about the progress achieved to date in the trade negotiations.', 'Four rounds of negotiations have now been completed, and there have been substantial advances on the main goods and services issues, with excellent progress on investment, public contracts, competition and intellectual property. While there are still certainly some points of disagreement, that is more an indication of the high and intense level at which the negotiations have taken place than of fundamental obstacles.', 'We share the great concern expressed by Parliament about the tariff increases imposed by Mexico and we will inform the Mexican authorities of it. We hope that Mexico will respond by eliminating these increases as rapidly as it can.', 'We trust that we will be able to achieve substantial results for the Rio summit in June so that this exercise can be concluded in the second half of the year. Obviously, Parliament\"s assent to the agreement will contribute significantly to providing important political impetus to allow us to conclude the process.', 'I want to assure you that the Commission formally undertakes to keep Parliament informed at all times – as is already the case – on the progress of these negotiations as well as the final outcome, before submitting the agreement to the whole Council. And, of course, the Commission will consult Parliament on that outcome, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty. So I cannot see that the Commission is being given a blank cheque. That is impossible, because Parliament will always have the last word when the negotiations are concluded.', 'Finally, the Commission hopes that Parliament will see fit to give its assent so that the agreement can enter into force, and we thank you again for the great support we have always received from this Parliament, not only with regard to strengthening relations with Mexico, but also with regard to establishing a real alliance between Europe and Latin America, which is gradually being forged.', 'Salafranca Sánchez‐Neyra (PPE). – (ES) Mr President, I would not want this debate to end without expressing, on behalf of my group, our recognition of the work Commissioner Marín has done as the Commissioner responsible for relations with Latin America. I also want to express our satisfaction because, in my opinion, as draftsman, the explanations and clarifications Mr Marín has given tonight entirely meet the Committee on Foreign Affairs\" demand that Parliament should be informed of the development of the negotiations before their conclusion. So many thanks, Mr Vice‐President of the Commission, for the information you have given and for your response to Parliament\"s proposals.', 'President . – I in turn would like to thank Vice‐President Marín for his period of cooperation with the European Parliament.', 'It has fallen to me to preside over many debates in which he has taken part, and I have always been struck by the attention he has paid to the views of Parliament and by his willingness to cooperate fully.', 'This evening has unfortunately turned into a marathon session. I have been in the Chair for more than three and a half hours.

In practice, it is an unreasonable burden on coach companies in Denmark to require them to ascertain how they are to calculate their price per kilometre since, for example, the tax office in Flensburg concludes individual agreements with coach operators, refuses to approve operating accounts approved by Danish state‐authorised auditors and often changes practice as far as the basis of calculation and administrative procedures are concerned. As a result, Germany has been holding back sums due to Danish operators, in one case for up to one and a half years, without paying interest on them.', 'Does the Council take the view that the above situation is in conformity with the rules of the internal market?

It is technically feasible to listen to a subject who is in a different country from the listening authority. Differing views prevail in the Member States firstly as to whether this should be permitted, and secondly as to whether a licence from the target country is required or if a notification to this effect is sufficient. In Finland there has been public concern about the interception of telecommunications, because all the preparatory documents concerning police cooperation and this Convention are secret. Can the Council guarantee the democratic control of the interception of telecommunications and the legal protection of the subjects of such interception? Does the Council intend to define the offences it regards as justifying the interception of telecommunications? How does the Council propose to guarantee that such interception will remain, in practice as well as in theory, the exclusive preserve of the competent authorities of the subject's own country? Does the Council propose to publish a summary of the differences between the EU Member States' provisions governing the interception of telecommunications? How does the Council propose to consult Parliament on the draft Convention pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty of Amsterdam (former Art. K.11)?\", 'Deposit', 'The purpose of the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is to complete the European Convention of 20 April 1959 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. The Council is examining in particular the inclusion of rules on the interception of telecommunications for the purpose of criminal investigations in EU Member States. Agreement on provisions in this area is not only in the interests of effectively combating serious crime but is particularly urgently needed to guarantee the legitimacy of cross‐border interception measures:', '‐ Requests for telephone interception have hitherto been approved on the basis of the 1959 Convention, although this does not contain any specific rules concerning the interception of telecommunications. For the new satellite telecommunications systems there are no provisions whatsoever concerning interception. What makes such situations unusual is that for interception purposes a link‐up may be required in a ground station in one Member State while the interception subject is in another Member State.', 'There is agreement between the Member States that where the Member State on whose territory the interception subject is located is, for specific technical reasons, not required to provide technical assistance for the interception, that Member State must nevertheless be involved by the Member State carrying out the interception. Such involvement is needed so that the Member State concerned can ensure that the interception of a person on its territory is in line with its domestic laws, and in particular with fundamental rights. The details of a regulation to this effect are currently being examined by the Council.', '‐ The draft does not contain a definition of the criminal offences that justify the issuing of an interception order, as it deals exclusively with relations between the Member States in cross‐border matters. The Council agrees, however, that the interception of telecommunications is to be judged in particular in relation to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the principle of proportionality.', '‐ There are no plans to limit interception measures to the authorities in the subject\"s own country, nor would this be appropriate in view of the particular nature of the new, modern satellite telecommunications described earlier. This would mean that a criminal who uses modern satellite telephones could not be intercepted, in contrast to a criminal who uses a standard telephone. The planned rules will guarantee that satellite telecommunications can also be intercepted.', '‐ National provisions on the interception of telecommunications in the Member States have been examined in the context of the European judicial network. An appropriate form of publication is being considered for the results. In view of the different national regulations the Council will examine in accordance with Article 131 of the Treaty of Amsterdam whether it will be necessary to bring Member States\" provisions into line with each other in order to improve cooperation.', '‐ The European Parliament was consulted on the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters under the UK Presidency.

There they were held down on wooden trestles on the ground and their throats were cut while they were fully conscious. Often the slaughter was carried out by untrained people who sawed backwards and forwards across the animals' throats sometimes with blunt knives. In many cases the animals took several minutes to die, often in great agony.\", \"Will the Commission now take action to require France to enforce the prohibition in Council Directive 93/119/EC(1) on outdoor religious slaughter and thereby prevent further barbaric killings taking place at next year's Eid‐el‐Kabir.\", 'Deposit', 'Following intervention of the Commission, France confirmed that Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing has been fully transposed within its territory. However, the French authorities have admitted that in certain urban areas having large Muslim populations there are inadequate slaughterhouse capacities to enable the considerable number of animals required for the celebration of Eid‐el‐Kabir at the time of the festival to be slaughtered in accordance with all the applicable legal requirements.', 'A number of local authorities have, for reasons of public order and public health, found it necessary to designate certain sites outside slaughterhouses for the purpose of celebration of the festival.', 'The Commission, taking into account the extreme sensitivity of the issue, has raised the matter within the Standing Veterinary Committee.', 'Most Member States have underlined that they have transposed the directive in such a way to prohibit slaughter outside the slaughterhouses. Two Member States, Belgium and the United Kingdom, however admitted that they allowed in their national law slaughtering outside slaughterhouses for the celebration of this festival. They realise that they had interpreted Community legislation incorrectly and will change their law in order to bring it back into line with Community legislation.', 'Apart from France, none of the other Member States seems to have capacity problems with the celebration of the festival Eid‐el‐Kabir or at least could organise the celebration of the festival in such a way that these problems do not arise. The Commission is in favour of a practical solution for the special problem concerning capacity.', 'Besides the capacity problem the honourable Member refers to the bad treatment of the animals during restraining and slaughtering. This is of course a distinct problem.', 'Bad treatment of the animals during restraining and slaughtering is not acceptable.

Nonetheless, the Commission recognises the public negative image of withdrawals and addressed two issues in the 1996 reform of the common organisation of the market. Firstly, it strives to reduce the overall level of withdrawals by providing financing to improve the marketing of produce and by making the withdrawal option less attractive, and in any case not profitable.', 'Secondly, it aims to reduce the level of destruction of withdrawn produce by developing various alternative uses, such as free distribution in schools, charities and humanitarian aid.

Is the Commission aware that these weapons systems are being used and, if so, what measures does it intend to take to stop them being used and to avert the danger of an environmental disaster?', 'Deposit', 'The Commission has no knowledge of the weapon systems used and has no intention to interfere with matters which are clearly not of its competence.', 'Any environmental implication of this conflict, whichever its origin, can only be assessed once it will be possible to start rehabilitation programmes.', 'Question No 52 by Alexandros Alavanos (H−0327/99)', 'Subject: Recruitment of staff in new hospitals funded under the second CSF', 'Under the convergence programme in Greece and the associated rationalisation measures, one person is to be recruited to the public service for every five persons leaving, while in the health and education sectors and in the police forces one person is to be recruited for every one person leaving.', 'At the same time, the Commission has approved the construction of 14 new hospitals, to be funded under the second Community support framework. Many of these have already been built but are not yet operational since they do not have the necessary staff. Most of the new establishments are university hospitals, their chief purpose being to improve the regional health services and reinforce the national health system. This has resulted in a total of about 5000 additional hospital beds, for which extra staff are needed. The restrictions imposed by the convergence programme must accordingly be lifted so that the requisite new posts can be created.', 'Will the Commission review the convergence programme for Greece concerning recruitment in the health sector, so that the necessary staff can be provided, thereby ensuring that the enormous investments made under the second CSF do not go to waste?', 'Deposit', \"According to Regulation 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 ‘on the strengthening of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies', the Commission prepares assessments of stability or convergence programmes submitted by Member States and makes recommendations for Council Options. The Commission is not entitled to revise the stability or convergence programmes submitted by Member States.\", 'According to the above Regulation, the convergence or stability programmes must provide information about the economic situation and prospects and the budgetary strategy that the Member States intend to implement in order to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact. Within this context the Member States are not required by the Regulation to respect specific norms for a single project or activity.', 'The Greek convergence programme for the period 1999‐2001 incorporates, among measures aimed at containing growth of public expenditure, a norm – already included in the 1998 budget – which provides for one new recruitment for every five civil servants leaving service, with the exception of education, health and the defence sectors where the ratio is 1: 1. How such a norm would be made compatible with investments made within the Community Support Framework is an issue pertaining to Greece in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.', 'Question No 53 by Paul Lannoye (H−0330/99)', 'Subject: Drogenbos incinerator', 'On 12 March, a number of opponents of the plans for a household waste incinerator at Drogenbos, just outside the capital of Europe, lodged a complaint with the Commission alleging a breach of the environmental impact assessment directive. The Commission found a series of shortcomings in the impact assessment and, on 21 January 1999, sent a letter of formal notice to Belgium which was given two months to provide an explanation.', 'Despite the widespread opposition to the project, above all because of concerns about the dangers it poses to public health and the environment and the failure to respect the precautionary principle, those behind the project are carrying on undeterred.', 'The deadline given to the Belgium state has now passed. Can the Commission say what its reaction is to the explanations provided by the Belgium state?', 'Deposit', 'Following the initial assessment of various complaints lodged against the Drogenbos incinerator project, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Belgium, in accordance with Article 226 (ex Article 169) of the EC Treaty.', 'The Commission has received a response from the Belgian authorities to that letter and is currently examining it.', 'It is important to note that in all likelihood the Commission will only decide how to follow up the present infringement proceedings when it receives a response from the Belgian authorities to the additional letter of formal notice it recently decided to send.', 'Question No 54 by Eva Kjer Hansen (HI-0332/99)', 'Subject: New German tax rules applying to foreign contractors', 'Under new tax laws applying from 1 April, a German client buying a house from a foreign building firm is only required to pay 75\\u2009% of the cost to the contractor when taking possession of the house. The German house‐buyer is required to send the remaining 25\\u2009% of the building cost to the tax authorities no later than eight days after taking possession. The foreign building firm cannot apply to have the balance due to it from the tax authorities until the following year. The introduction of these rules amounts to pure German protectionism and an obstruction to trade contrary to EU rules. This legislation means in practice that foreign firms must give the German tax authorities an interest‐free loan for up to one year.', 'What steps will the Commission take (or has it taken) to put an end to this unreasonable discrimination against foreign companies in Germany where, under new tax rules, foreign companies, but not German companies, are required to deposit 25\\u2009% of their contract proceeds with the tax authorities?', 'Deposit', 'The Commission has just received the text of the German Act published on 31 March 1999 and has immediately started to examine it. The Commission will come to an early assessment of the compatibility of the new rules, against which formal complaints from affected enterprises have also already been received.', 'The new German tax rules aim at combating tax fraud; such rules are welcomed by the Commission. They must however respect Community law, in particular the freedom to provide services and the principles of non‐discrimination and proportionality. It is true that the 25\\u2009% withholding tax (as a guarantee deposit for potential tax liability) appears rather high and might prove to go beyond the legitimate aim.', 'However, the Commission is waiting for a clarification on the practice on the delivery of the waiver certificates. This should result from a coordination meeting of the tax administrations of the German Länder in charge of the application at the end of April 1999. It will be in the light of the effective application of the Act that the Commission will have to decide whether there are grounds to open infringement proceedings against Germany.', 'Question no 55 by Luciano Vecchi (H - 0333/99)', 'Subject: Observers at the elections in Nigeria in February 1999', 'During the Nigerian National Assembly and presidential elections (held on 20 February 1999 and 27 February 1999 respectively), the EU Member States and the Commission sent over a hundred observers to monitor the election process.', 'Many of the reports and comments by the observers expressed harsh criticism of the way in which polling was conducted in many areas of Nigeria. In particular, there are substantial discrepancies in both timing and content between the statement presented by the Commission delegate in Nigeria and the reports by the observers.', 'Although Nigeria has undeniably made considerable progress in recent months on the difficult road towards democracy, this situation has led to much tension between many observers and the Community institutions and raises serious questions about the real task which the observers were called upon to perform.', \"Can the Commission say why the assessments of the observers sent by the EU and the Member States to monitor the conduct of the elections in Nigeria have not been taken properly into account? In the circumstances, does it give its political endorsement to the actions of the spokesman for the EU observers' mission, Ambassador Hans‐Günter Sulimma?\", 'Deposit', \"The Commission fully agrees that the way the polling was conducted in many areas of Nigeria deserves criticism. The Union statement, based on Ambassador Sulimma's conclusions, states clearly that a number of serious irregularities were encountered. The observers have thus performed an extremely useful task in exposing these irregularities, which point up the fragile nature of the current transition in Nigeria. The Presidency statement also calls for the irregularities to be investigated.\", 'This evidence from the observers has led the Commission to examine, together with other donors, future support for strengthening of the Electoral Commission, to ensure more effective performance in future elections. Democracy in Nigeria has advanced dramatically over the past year, but it will take much longer than one year for democratic practices and attitudes to be entrenched securely.', 'The Commission believes that Ambassador Sulimma did take proper account of these assessments of the observers in his statement on the Presidential elections. His judgement, based on the initial reports, is justified by later detailed analysis.', 'The election process consisted of four stages: accreditation, voting, counting and collation. Union observers reported serious irregularities, at these four stages, in 10\\u2009%, 28\\u2009%, 16\\u2009% and 5\\u2009% of cases respectively. The most irregularities (28\\u2009%), then, were observed at the voting stage. Given that observers also noted that these irregularities (ballot‐stuffing, etc.) were committed by both parties, it is reasonable to conclude that they did not affect the overall outcome, in which Olusegun Obasanjo defeated Olu Falae by a margin of 24\\u2009% (62\\u2009% to 38\\u2009%). This important conclusion was also reached by other groups of observers.', 'After an election, information reaches the Union spokesman at a high rate. First he receives initial and partial reports, and later more detailed reports. His analysis of them also becomes more detailed and complete as time passes. His information is primarily from Union observers, but he also stays in contact with other observer missions to know what information they are receiving.', 'At some point it becomes possible for him to make a confident judgement as to the overall nature of the process. It is essential that he release a statement as early as possible after this point, since the relevance of statements decreases rapidly, the later they are released. This is a very difficult determination to make. Ambassador Sulimma made the judgement that this point had been reached on Sunday 28 February. His judgement has been confirmed by later analyses from different sources. They indicate that there were indeed serious irregularities; but that there is no evidence suggesting that the true result was other than a victory for Obasanjo.', 'Question No 56 by Anne McIntosh (H−0335/99)', 'Subject: Duty‐free sales', 'What interim measures does the Commission intend to take to simplify sales after intra‐EU duty‐free sales stop on 1 July 1999, in order to prevent different prices being charged for the same product depending on which territorial waters or airspace the sale is made in?', 'Deposit', 'In the course of the various discussions which have taken place, particularly within Parliament, on the forthcoming abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free sales, the Commission has explained what the situation of such sales will be vis‐à‐vis the normal rules on taxation with effect from 1 July 1999. No transitional measures are envisaged.', 'Furthermore, the Commission has for a number of months been in contact with the authorities which are responsible in the Member States for implementing the relevant Community provisions and with operators (ferry companies, airlines, etc.), with a view to determining the conditions under which the taxes are to be levied.', 'To help clarify matters for the benefit of the general public and the various interested parties, the Commission has also recently published, on 10 April 1999, a communication on the subject in the Official Journal.', 'Question No 57 by John McCartin (H−0363/99)', 'Subject: Action to tackle specific employment problems related to duty‐free sales', \"What follow up action has been undertaken by the Commission following the Commission's Communication of November 1998 on offsetting the possible consequences of the abolition of intra‐EU duty‐free sales?

This Communication concluded that an extension of the transitional period is not the appropriate response to specific and locally identified problems, but that Member States must fully use the existing Community funds to solve such difficulties.', 'No specific request from any Member State has been received regarding reallocation of existing structural funds in this context. The Council has not yet examined the above‐mentioned communication of the Commission, in particular as regards the need to create a separate new measure to tackle any specific and local employment problems that may arise.', 'Question No 58 by Caroline Jackson (H−0336/99)', 'Subject: Phare‐Lien programme Application 98‐1218', 'This application concerns partners in Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Albania and, in the EU, the European Union of Women. It aimed to generate potential to participate in the democratic process. Can the Commission now state fully why the application did not fulfil all the eligibility and conformity criteria defined in the LIEN 1998 guidelines? If the objection was that the European Union of Women is a political organisation, why was this not made clear at the outset, especially since EUW was given the indication that, so long as the project was open to all, this would not affect how the application was viewed? Why did it take the Commission until March 1999 to respond to an application submitted in May 1998?', 'Deposit', 'The Commission can confirm that the proposal from the European Union of Women failed to meet the eligibility criteria of the LIEN programme. The screening of the eligibility of all organisations who applied for the programme was based solely on the criteria indicated in the LIEN guidelines made available to all applicants.

The proposal of the EUW was among them. It failed in particular to provide proof of its own and its partners' status as an NGO. However, the EUW was not disqualified because it is a political organisation.\", 'After being informed about the selection results, the EUW requested additional information about the selection. The EUW was provided with a detailed written reply explaining the points where the proposal of the EUW did not meet the required criteria.', 'There was a delay in processing the applications due to difficulties in contracting technical assistance to help with the execution of the programme, as well as staff changes and reorganisation within the Commission.

Is the European Union aware of the dangers and how does it ensure compliance with the precautionary principle? Mr Larbi Bougherra, President of the human progress foundation, suspects MMT, the compound which has replaced lead in petrol to maintain a good octane rating, to be highly toxic, carcinogenic and dangerous for human health and the environment. Is the Commission aware of this fact, and what is it doing to ascertain the innocuousness of the new products that are flooding the market each day?', 'Deposit', 'The protection of human health, including that of consumers, and of the environment against the possible dangers of chemical substances is guaranteed by many Community legislative instruments. Among other things, these directives and regulations set out the rules on the classification, packaging and labelling of chemical substances and preparations for products they are used in, as well as the limitations on marketing and using certain dangerous substances and preparations.', 'Respect for these rules at national level guarantees the high level of protection for health and the environment in the Community. The Commission is anxious to maintain and improve this level of protection.

At the end of this assessment, the Commission will forward a communication to Parliament and to the Council bringing together all the elements for a future Community ‘chemical\" strategy, including legislative options.', 'As regards MMT, this manganese‐based compound is added to petrol or diesel to increase the level of octane with a view to improving combustion.', 'Although manganese is an essential nutrient at low levels, high‐level manganese exposure leads to a characteristic severe nervous system toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity also occurs at high levels of exposure. Selected subpopulations may be especially susceptible to the toxic effects due to high levels of exposure to manganese, for instance, workers.', 'As regards the protection of workers that could be exposed to MMT, Council Directive 98/24/EC on the protection of workers from chemical agents specifies in its Article 4 that the employer must evaluate the risks of exposure, taking into account all available information, and establish the necessary protection measures to reduce the exposure.', 'Studies have shown that only a very small percentage of the manganese from MMT added to fuels was diffused in the atmosphere.

This priority has been addressed in the EU Action Plan to combat organised crime, adopted in 1997. The Commission has actively contributed to its implementation and considers that a number of initiatives deriving from it have had a direct effect on citizens' daily life. Good examples are the fight against trafficking in human beings, the fight against trafficking in drugs, stealing of vehicles or different forms of financial crime. These initiatives have all contributed to increase the general level of security in urban areas.\", 'Concerning urban security and police tasks, cooperation between European police authorities on issues of security management, including urban security, have been going on for a number of years. One of the last examples is the Joint Action on Prevention of Hooliganism. The Joint Action is expected to be finalised in the near future. In addition, an initiative has been started to collect and disseminate information on good practice at the level of police authorities.', 'In addition, the Commission has examined how it could mobilise existing financial instruments of the EU in creating a more secure urban environment. Projects aimed at increasing safety as a precondition for economic development have been financed last year by the European Fund for Regional Development. It remains, however, the initiative of national and regional authorities to introduce such projects. In the area of social policy, some budget lines also contribute to improving the economic situation in specific neighbourhoods. The budget lines related to the Integra employment programme, the poverty programme, the town twinning programme and above all, the Urban initiatives have all directly or indirectly contributed to reduce violence and crime.', 'Concerning the specific issue of urban security, the Commission proposed in autumn 1998 an Action Plan for urban sustainable development on which the European Parliament is presently consulted. This Action Plan considers four interrelated objectives concerning economic development, social and urban rehabilitation, environment and good governance. Under this last objective, the Commission will support new strategies to promote urban security issues.

Both the OISIN and the Falcone programmes are open to cooperation projects of local and regional authorities as well as to NGOs. Their purpose is to facilitate dissemination of knowledge, to encourage contacts between actors engaged in providing a secure environment and to support reflections on best practice on how to improve security and prevent certain forms of crime which occur at urban level. As an example, the OISIN programme supports two projects on urban security and on proximity police. The Falcone programme will have to decide in the coming days on projects concerning a study on the relation between small crime and organised crime and a coordinated system for dissemination of best practice.', 'The Commission will continue to examine the experience and needs at local level and determine where and how the EU dimension can best be used in order to assure a safe local neighbourhood.', 'Question no 67 by Carlo Ripa di Meana (H - 0362/99)', 'Subject: Provision of know‐how and financial support to the Shifco fleet by the EC', \"A civil lawsuit has been taken out at a Rome court by the owner of the Shifco fleet, the engineer Omar Said Mugne, against the authors and publishers of a book entitled ‘L'esecuzione' (published by Kaos).

When will this provision be adjusted with a view to the European elections on 13 June?\", 'Deposit', 'This matter does not come under the Commission\"s responsibilities.', 'Question No 69 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H−0370/99)', 'Subject: Protection of persons providing information', 'Before the Commission resigned, Paul van Buitenen, the internal auditor, was suspended from duty on half pay. Since then, he has obtained a new post in another Commission department. This and similar cases raise the question of the need to allow Commission staff the freedom to provide information, which in Sweden, for example, is a right enshrined in the constitution.', \"Does the Commission consider that the right of Commission staff to provide information should now be a matter for debate in the light of events prior to the Commission's resignation?\", 'Deposit', 'The Commission has noted the honourable Member\"s comments regarding the freedom of expression of the Commission\"s staff and the staff of the other institutions. Possible solutions to this must be considered in the light of their own merits and the practices in all the Member States of the Union.', 'Question No 70 by Philippe Monfils (H−0371/99)', 'Subject: The UIP case', 'The cartel of three major Hollywood film studios (UIP) which have pooled their distribution services for Europe is covered by a derogation under Article 85(3) of the Treaty of Rome. This derogation is due to expire, and the Commission is currently considering whether or not to renew it. Given the significance of the UIP case – which cannot be treated as run‐of‐the‐mill – and the enormous political pressure which is being brought to bear on the Commission in this connection, should the outgoing Commission not postpone taking a decision on this matter, so as to allow the new Commission to take a decision which is of vital importance for the future of the European film industry?', 'Deposit', \"Since UIP in 1993 applied for a renewal of the 1989 exemption, the Commission has thoroughly investigated whether UIP has been involved in any anti‐competitive behaviour or activities not envisaged at the time of the previous exemption. The Commission has also examined UIP's effects on the film distribution market.\", \"The Commission has notably found that, although the market has shown a sound tendency of growth and expansion, UIP's Community wide market share has decreased from 22\\u2009% in 1989 to 13\\u2009% in 1997.\", \"Furthermore, UIP is willing to give a number of new undertakings to accommodate concerns raised against UIP (e.g. UIP will not coordinate the release dates of the parties' films or use block bookings).\", 'The Commission is likely to publish a notice in the Official Journal soon inviting third parties to comment on a possible renewal of the exemption.', 'In competition cases, where the Commission acts as the guardian of the Treaties, the outgoing Commission continues to assume its responsibilities and considers that there is no reason to postpone procedures.', 'Question no 71 by José Valverde López (H - 0374/99)', 'Subject: EU Model for Medical Prescription', \"The free movement of persons, freedom of establishment for health professionals and the single market in medicines mean that a single model for medical prescriptions must be established.

It still considers that major legal, political and technical obstacles remain before the development of Community legislation in this field could be considered.\", \"The Commission, in close cooperation with Member States' Ministries of Health, continues to keep both matters under consideration.\", 'Question No 72 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H−0380/99)', 'Subject: Utilisation by the Greek government of Community funds to highlight Government achievements prior to the elections', \"The Greek Government has recently been using Community resources to fund a series of advertising campaigns to draw attention to the Greek Community Support Framework; however they fail sufficiently to highlight the Community nature of the projects concerned and overemphasise the Government's contribution. There are also reports of similar campaigns to be launched shortly. These campaigns coincide with a large‐scale election campaign by the Government party which also makes extensive reference to Agenda 2000: this makes Greek citizens even more confused. All these measures are being taken a mere two months before the Euro‐elections in June 1999 when the country is in a pre‐electoral period, and the impression is easily created that Community resources are being used to fund the Government's election campaign. Given that in similar circumstances in the local elections in 1998 the Commission, following my question (H−0543/98)(4) , intervened with the Greek Government and reached an agreement with the latter that the information campaign should be postponed until after the two‐month pre‐electoral period, will it say whether it intends to take similar action in this case, since the problem is on a larger scale this time because European elections are involved?\", 'Question No 77 by Georgios Anastassopoulos (H−0390/99)', 'Subject: Use of Community funding for government publicity in the run‐up to elections', \"Why does the Commission not carry out the necessary checks to ensure that the funds provided from the various Community programmes (Community Support Framework, European Social Fund etc.) are actually used to promote the Community's contribution to the development of the Greek economy and not for government publicity?\", 'In view of the fact that this tendency has recently become more pronounced in the run‐up to the European elections on 13 June, will the Commission say what measures it has taken and whether it considers it appropriate that these government campaigns with Community money be stopped and information to the Greek public about Community programmes be resumed after 15 June, as happened last year before the regional and local elections in Greece?', 'Joint answer', 'The Commission has already set out its position on this issue at Parliament\"s part‐session of June 1998(5) . In general, it is satisfied with the implementation of the publicity and information campaigns that are cofinanced by the ‘technical assistance\" operational programme of the Community support framework for Greece.', 'A group made up of representatives of the relevant ministry and the Commission, under the authority of the programme\"s monitoring committee, supervises the campaign and decides on the measures that are to be taken in case of any specific problems. It was in this context that it was decided last year to temporarily suspend the campaign during the local elections.', 'The same reasoning applies to the campaign before the European elections. As a result, the Greek authorities announced that the campaign would be suspended from 1 May to mid‐June.', 'Question No 73 By María Sornosa Martínez (H - 0382/99)', 'Subject: Measures to reform large psychiatric hospitals and promotion of out‐patient facilities in Greece', 'In 1984, the EU began to subsidise – and is continuing to do so – the improvement of mental health services in Greece, initially through Regulation 815/84/EEC(6) and subsequently through the Psychargo programme. The results so far have been poor. The fundamental reasons why there has been no reform of the mental health system to date are that the experience, planning and efficiency of the mental health services in the other Member States have not been taken on board, that the funds given to the big psychiatric hospitals have not significantly changed their outmoded practices and that the Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare has not taken a global approach to planning, using a timetable and, principally, Greek government resources to set up and operate services in the community (outpatient facilities).', 'Will the Commission change the entire modus operandi of the system by implementing the Psychargo programme and what practical measures are planned to improve the effectiveness of reforms in the large psychiatric hospitals and to promote outpatient facilities?', 'Question No 74 by Honório Novo (H−0383/99)', 'Subject: Effectiveness of Psychargo programme funding in Greece', 'The state of Greek psychiatric units (asylums) and the inadequate standard of psychiatric prevention and care generally, together with the failure of Regulation 815/84/EEC(7) and the ineffective use of resources allocated under this Regulation, have occasionally exercised the European Parliament, the relevant Commission services and the international media.', 'The Greek governments between 1984 and 1995 and also the Commission have been held responsible for failing to implement the five‐year psychiatric reform plan drawn up in 1984: resources were misallocated and the programme was a failure so that the shortcomings persist to this day.', 'Will the Commission say whether the relevant Commission services have taken measures to ensure that the new funding for the Psychargo programme is allocated effectively?', 'Question No 75 by Pedro Marset Campos (H−0384/99)', 'Subject: Improving the functioning of psychiatric asylums and the network of outpatient facilities', 'The European Parliament has already considered the tragic state of psychiatric care in Greece. One of the most serious problems which Regulation 815/84/EEC(8) failed to address successfully was the lack of basic outpatient facilities, mental health centres, mobile units, day centres, child‐guidance centres, etc.', 'Today only a small portion of the population is covered by these services. However, experience in the EU Member States shows that an improvement in the functioning of asylums and de‐institutionalisation are impossible unless such a network of outpatient facilities exists. Will the Commission say whether it intends, in cooperation with the Greek government, to use the new subsidies that have been approved under the Psychargo programme for this purpose?', 'Joint answer', 'Under Regulation 815/84 an important reform was introduced into the Greek psychiatric care system involving the gradual replacement of the institution‐based system of psychiatric care by a network of alternative prevention led and therapeutic mental health services and facilities based in the community or in general hospitals. Moreover, provision was made for the development of social and vocational rehabilitation services throughout the country.', 'Regulation 815/84 applied from 1984 to 1995. After 1995, psychiatric reform remained fragile because it had not been accompanied by the required legal and administrative arrangements for its consolidation and further development.', \"In order to secure a more systematic continuation of the reform in the context of the 1994‐99 Community Support Framework for Greece, and in particular under the Operational Programme on Combating Exclusion from the Labour Market, the Commission requested the Greek authorities to prepare an action plan for the completion and consolidation of psychiatric reform. In the framework of this plan, which has been called ‘PSYCHARGOS', actions eligible under Structural Fund Regulations could be financed by the Community.\", 'In parallel, a Bill on Mental Health was drafted. It is expected to be adopted soon by the Greek Parliament. The Psychargos plan, which is largely dependent on the Bill, will then be finalised.', 'In the meantime, the Commission has approved a special action (which will be part of the PSYCHARGOS plan when this will be finalised) to be financed by the Operational Programme on Combating Exclusion from the Labour Market. This action includes therapeutic and training interventions for the rehabilitation of people with mental health problems residing in all psychiatric hospitals of the country; the creation and development of new extra‐mural structures for independent living and rehabilitation; reinforcing and broadening the training and employment opportunities of people with mental health problems and staffing and training of the staff of the new extra‐mural structures. The relevant activities are expected to be launched by the end of June 1999.', 'Both during the application of Regulation 815/84 and in the current programming period the Commission has made, and plans to continue to make use of the expertise available in other Member States in the specific field.', 'Question No 76 by Lone Dybkjær (H−0386/99)', 'Subject: Blue Flag Campaign – follow‐up to answer to H−0287/99', 'In question H−0287/99(9) the Commission was asked whether organisations are able to ascertain how many complaints have been received and what they are about in cases where complaints are directed against themselves and are used as a justification for depriving them of financial assistance.', 'I do not know whether the Commission cannot or does not want to understand the question but the fact is that it has not answered it.', 'It is understandable that the identity of the complainant should be kept confidential but it is in fact the number and content of complaints that are of interest to those against whom complaints are lodged.', 'Where the FEEE is deprived of financial aid on the basis of complaints, can the FEEE be granted access to the number and content of such complaints and hence an opportunity to respond to them as long as the identity of the complainant is concealed?', 'Deposit', 'The Commission decided not to fund the 1999 Blue Flag campaign for both financial and technical reasons. First, the Commission had some questions concerning the administrative management of the subsidy. The FEEE did not provide requested documents justifying expenses on a timely basis.', \"Second, the Commission was concerned about the allegations of deficient control procedures by the national operators of the campaign during the bathing season, and in particular in case of complaints against FEEE on the handling of its scheme. Given these circumstances, the Commission did not grant financial support for the 1999 Blue Flag campaign under the ‘Call for the submission of proposals for general measures to inform and increase awareness of the environment'.\", 'By letter of 17.2.1999, the FEEE was informed that there were three complaining letters at the moment containing allegations on Blue Flag Scheme (2 concerning Spain and 1 concerning the United Kingdom). As these letters had referred to the Bathing Water Directive(10) , the Commission had registered them as complaints following the Commission rules. However, detailed assessment revealed that the letters did not raise issues of compliance with Community law but other aspects of Blue Flag Scheme, like deficient control procedures by FEEE national operators during the bathing season. As the cases did not raise issues of compliance with Community law, the Commission did not have powers to deal with these complaints and it invited the complainants to address their concerns directly to FEEE. If they did so, FEEE should be aware of the details of the allegations.', 'The Commission has suggested to FEEE that in the case of complaints from the public, such as those mentioned above (concerning the handling of the scheme), the current response via the national operators should be complemented with some form of independent assessment, in order to ensure that the procedure is fair and impartial.', 'In the framework of the call for proposals in the field of environment (OJ No C 357, 21.11.1998, 98/357/07), FEEE submitted an application for funding for the year 2000 campaign.

This was pursuant to its duty to ensure compliance with United Kingdom Law. According to the United Kingdom authorities, the channel was in breach of its licence requirements, and also in breach of UK Law. In particular, the United Kingdom authorities have informed the Commission that MED‐TV broadcast programmes which encouraged acts of violence and which were likely to encourage or incite to crime or lead to disorder; the revocation of the licence followed a period of monitoring by the ITC which had issued a number of warnings to the channel that it was in breach of its licence requirements and the ITC code.', 'Under these circumstances, the United Kingdom authorities appear to have been executing their obligations under the Television Directive and thus under Community Law.']}]}\n"

      "President . – We shall now move on to the votes. Proposal for a Council Regulation (ECSC, EC, EURATOM) incorporating daily subsistence allowance rates for officials on mission within the European territory of the Member States of the European Union for Austria, Finland and Sweden into Article 13 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities (COM(99)0133 – C4‐0226/99‐99/0076(CNS)) (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 laying down the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Communities (COM(99)0102 – C4‐0159/99‐99/0065(CNS)) President . – The next item is in principle the report by Mr Jarzembowski. However, I have to tell the House that we have not yet received the opinion of the Committee of the Regions. With your agreement, I should like to defer this item. We are waiting for the information, and if it arrives in good time, it can still be taken into account. Report (A4‐0253/99) by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications (3612/99 – C4‐0209/99‐96/0031(COD)) (Parliament approved the joint text) Report (A4‐0226/99) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States with a view to reducing the data to be provided (3608/99 – C4‐0172/99‐97/0155(COD)) Report (A4‐0243/99) by Mr Schmid, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft Council Resolution on the lawful interception of telecommunications in relation to new technologies (10951/2/98 – C4‐0052/99‐99/0906(CNS)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A4‐0234/99) by Mr Malangré, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Convention on Insolvency Proceedings (Parliament adopted the resolution) Swoboda (PSE). – (DE) Madam President, I wholeheartedly endorse what Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten said about your conduct of our business, but with all due respect I would urge that we should vote on the Jarzembowski report. We discussed the possibility with the Legal Service of voting today and forwarding the results later, subject to receiving the approval of the Committee of the Regions. There are still quite a lot of Members here for a Friday, which is why I would seriously urge you to hold the vote. President . – We had intended to wait for this, Mr Swoboda, but I have just been informed that the answer from the Committee of the Regions is no longer expected to arrive today. I shall therefore put this to the vote now. Recommendation for second reading (A4‐0245/99), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council (13651/3/98 – C4‐0037/99‐96/0182(COD) – former 96/0182(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Rapporteur: Mr Jarzembowski) (The President declared the common position approved) President . – I would point out that this approval will only take effect once the opinion of the Committee of the Regions has been received, pursuant to Article 71 of the Amsterdam Treaty. Wijsenbeek (ELDR). – (NL) Madam President, I just wanted to point out that we should adopt this provisional opinion. I would also like to compliment you on your new hair style. (Laughter) President . – In fact it is not new, but one always looks a little fresher after a visit to the hairdresser! - - Gebhardt Report (A4-0253/99) Caudron (PSE), in writing. – (FR) I should like to begin by congratulating the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens\" Rights and the rapporteur for all her hard work during the procedure involved in drawing up this proposal for a directive on the recognition of qualifications, a subject which is a highly sensitive one in the Member States. The negotiations with the Council have not exactly been easy, but they have produced a fairly satisfactory compromise, even though as we all know a compromise is always just the least worst solution. I must admit that some progress has been made in this field since the 1960s. We have gradually moved from sectoral directives regulating various activities to a horizontal approach based on the principle of mutual recognition and two key directives from 1989 and 1992. Clearly, I support the proposals to repeal the sectoral directives. These were supposed to be directives on liberalisation, but in fact they involved various measures that were intended to be transitional but which went on for much longer than necessary, inevitably producing restrictions on freedom of movement and freedom of establishment. I am also in favour of improving and consolidating the general systems for the recognition of qualifications. Although there is fairly satisfactory provision in law for the recognition of qualifications, it is not adequately translated into practice, and Europe\"s citizens still face too many problems when they try to use their professional qualifications and experience in other Member States. I know what I am talking about, because I have heard stories from many young French students wanting to work in Belgium, particularly in the medical field, about the rejections they have faced. Another even more flagrant example of discrimination is the situation of foreign language assistants at universities in Italy, which everyone has heard about. I think these kinds of situations are extremely serious. They are worrying not just because of their effect on the free movement of people and freedom of establishment, but above and beyond that because they are a threat to European citizenship. How can we expect Community nationals to feel any sort of sense of belonging to the European Union if, in their everyday lives or in doing something as natural as looking for work, they are rejected just because they come from one Member State or another? The problem is a very complex one, I know. This is why we need to deal with it, so that it is easier for workers to move around within the European Union. The recognition of qualifications is one way of going about this, and the proposal we are considering today is a step in the right direction. - Malangré Report (A4-0234/99) Bru Purón (PSE). – (ES) Madam President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Malangré because I believe that it is of great importance and that its content is extremely sound. The last committee report for this parliamentary term confirms the old adage of ‘last but not least\". It responds to a pressing need, and the lack of attention it has received until now is at odds with the intensive harmonisation achieved in so many aspects of commercial law, from company law to some specific points on insolvency, such as deposit‐guarantee schemes for trouble‐stricken credit institutions. The lack of minimum rules for insolvency proceedings has enormous repercussions for the Union\"s territory as it means that the single market is being built without a roof. Mr Malangré\"s proposal is based on Article 65 of the EC Treaty, as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty, and I support it. However, I understand that this is not only a procedural issue and that with Article 65, we would find ourselves in a situation whereby unanimity is required in the Council. For this reason, I should like to point out to future legislators that the basis provided by Article 95 – ex Article 100a – is valuable in terms of approximating all the provisions that relate to the workings of the internal market by means of a directive. Hallam (PSE). – Madam President, on a point of order. I wonder if, on my last day in Parliament, you could just solve a little mystery for me. How is it that somebody who is not present and has not taken part in the vote can submit an explanation of vote? I am fascinated by this! President . – You are right, Mr Hallam. One can only give an explanation of vote if one has actually taken part in the vote. But that is checked carefully every time.\n"
